<h1>Ultraweb.hu: The Shit</h1>
<p>2006-06-22 12:04:43 GMT</p>
<p><strong>Update (2007-02-14)</strong>: I've finally paid the price, because they threatened me with legal actions.  I asked some advices from a lawyer regarding this situation, so I'll be more clever next time in such cases.  As a side note, it's impossible to unsubscribe from their mailing list, so they can be also considered spammers.</p>
<p>Ultraweb.hu is the former hosting provider of monda.hu.  I had problems with them so I moved to another hosting provider about three months ago, to <a title="http://mediacenter.hu" href="http://mediacenter.hu">mediacenter.hu</a> which I'm very pleased with.</p>
<p>Some days ago, I got a two checks from Ultraweb.  The first was about the hosting price of the last year, which seemed a bit higher that is mentioned on their home page.  The second was about the hosting price of the next year which is quite ridiculous, because I'm no longer their customer.  I've emailed them about these pricing issues.  They didn't answer 3 working days later, so I emailed them again.  2 days passed, no answers, so I tried to call them on the phone.  It wasn't easy to find a contact number to begin with, but when I called them, I felt pretty pissed off.</p>
<p>I call them, I immediately hear a female voice: "Your call is important to us.  You are the first client on the queue.  Please hold on!".  Stupid music for two minutes…  After that again: "Your call is important to us.  You are the first client on the queue.  Please hold on!".  Stupid music for some minutes again…  At that point, I fucking put down the phone.</p>
<p>Well, I've finally made the decision that I won't pay a fucking cent to these bastards.  To understand my situation here's what they should mention on their home page about the quality of their service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many times our servers are so fucking overloaded, that your site becomes inaccessible.  Sorry for the inconvience.</li>
<li>Major administrative outages will frequently occur, which usually means that you cannot write your web space for several days.  You won't get notified about any of these outages, of course.</li>
<li>Our customer support has quality issues.  To be honest we don't exactly have a customer support, just a pimpled teenager, jerking off all day to lesbian porn.</li>
<li>It's all shit, we admit it, but what can you expect for this price, fucker?</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also noticed that they don't have any slogans.  I think they should really have one, because it's really important from a marketing point of view.  Here are some of my ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's cheap shit.  Pay the price and get lost!</li>
<li>Customer support?  We don't have such a thing.</li>
<li>Ultraweb.hu – for all the fuckers who wanna suffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also made an updated logo for them.  I think it became pretty good:</p>
