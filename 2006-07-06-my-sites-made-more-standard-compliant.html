<h1>My Sites Made More Standard Compliant</h1>
<p>2006-07-06 12:15:10 GMT</p>
<p>I've just finished improving <a href="">my home page</a>, <a href="/blog">my blog</a> and <a href="http://ultimatecommander.org" title="http://ultimatecommander.org">ultimatecommander.org</a>.</p>
<p>I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>upgraded all the CMSes to their latest version,</li>
<li>revamped the skins, so that users that are not logged in cannot see the links related to the authoring functions and</li>
<li>made the sites almost 100% XHTML compliant.  Well I didn't want to hack the DokuWiki parser any longer, that's why some of my blog pages didn't validate correctly because of some evil blockquote tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pretty satisfied with the results, overall.</p>
