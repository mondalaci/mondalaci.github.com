<h1>Migrated my news blogging to Tumblr</h1>

<p>Today morning it's been an experience to notice that Google has fucked up Reader so badly as nobody could foresee.  As to how such abomination could have ever been created by a company that is supposed to create web applications of superior usability is <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader/thread?tid=20cff905a323f294&hl=en">surely beyond me</a>, but as a result of this event I migrated from the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/16423546940447935835">abandoned shared items page</a> to <a href="http://mondalaci.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>This post could have been tweeted due to its small size but I ultimately decided to post it there because of its significance.</p>
