<h1>Planet GNOME Archives Is Alive</h1>
<p>2006-06-02 23:06:11 GMT</p>
<p><strong>Update (2006-06-07)</strong>: Planet GNOME Archives is no longer available publicly.  See my post: "<a href="http://monda.hu/blog/2006/06/07/planet-gnome-archives-is-down-planet-archiver-is-available/">Planet GNOME Archives Is Down, Planet Archiver is Available</a>" for the explanation.</p>
<p>I'm addicted to <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/" title="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a>.  It's the richest resource I read on a regular basis.  Lots of talented people writing here about mostly GNOME related and generally Free Software related stuff and one can learn a lot by reading their posts.</p>
<p>I had only one problem with it, though: <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/" title="http://www.planetplanet.org/">PlanetPlanet</a> is not able to generate feed archives, so it is not possible to go back in history and read the earlier posts that the GNOME folks made.  If I forget to visit or can't visit Planet GNOME for 3 days or more, I drop behind and there are phases in my life when I don't have so much time and it's a pain in my ass.  I could use a web based feed reader with cron, but unfortunately none of the readers are good enough for my choosey taste, so I had to choose a different approach to solve this issue.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Planet GNOME Archives <em>[link removed]</em>!  (I like the name, came out with it myself.)  It must be pretty damn intuitive to use, because of the extra JavaScript love I gave to this babe.  Motto: "No readers get left behind!"</p>
<p>I haven't used JavaScript for a long time, but despite of this fact, it was really a pleasure.  Enjoy!</p>
