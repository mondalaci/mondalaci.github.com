<h1>Developing in C# under Linux</h1>
<p>2005-12-14 19:08:13 GMT</p>
<p>Unfortunately developing C# applications under Linux is still a pain.  I've tried out many different C# editors in the past few days (there are not so many) which work under Linux and I found Eclipse with the <a href="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp" title="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp">Improve C# plugin</a> the best.  This thing doesn't even support class browsing, but it's generally usable and has a good VCS support.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.monodevelop.org/Main_Page" title="http://www.monodevelop.org/Main_Page">Monodevelop</a> is obviously more stable than its previous release, but it's still not there and has no version control integrated yet.  It'll probably maturing stable in the next few months, though.</p>
