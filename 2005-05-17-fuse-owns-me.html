<p>FUSE - Filesystem In UserSpace.  Have you ever heard of it?  In case you don't, you should know what's it's all about because it's quite damn intuitive.  But if you're dumb, never mind, I'll tell you anyway ;-)</p>
<p>FUSE basically makes one able to develop his/her filesytem in userspace (yeah, I'm a genious to comprehend its purpose and plainly translate it to you).  I plan to use it in the future.  You may check <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">it</a> out, as well as its <a href="http://pyflag.sourceforge.net/Documentation/articles/fuse.html">Python</a> and <a href="http://arg0.net/users/vgough/sulf/">Mono</a> bindings.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2005-May/050240.html">FreeBSD dude went mad</a>.  This happens when you use a not-really-innovative-on-the-desktop OS.  Read it, because it's really funny.</p>
