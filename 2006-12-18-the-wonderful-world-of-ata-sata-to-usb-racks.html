<h1>The Wonderful World of ATA-SATA to USB Racks</h1>
<p>2006-12-18 19:29:00 GMT</p>
<p>I've just bought a pretty good ATA-SATA combo USB rack.  It's a very convenient solution if you wanna carry your stuff around and need a universal solution for all your HDDs.  I thought it'd be useful to compile a list of the racks I know about, so here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>HDIU350PS (I haven't found its manufacturer)</li>
<li>Conceptronic CHD3SIU</li>
<li>Sino UAZK-F11</li>
<li>DataTec DS350PS</li>
<li>Fantec DB-35US-1</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't have any experiences with them, so you should read their reviews.</p>
