<h1>Linksys 5-Port 10-100 Workgroup Switch disassembly</h1>

<p>It's my pretty switch that I use in our family house at Harta.  Unfortunately, I couldn't remove the heat sink from the main IC to see its type without destroying it so I didn't.  Apart from that, the amount of the power supply and EMI circuitry is rather surprising to me.</p>
