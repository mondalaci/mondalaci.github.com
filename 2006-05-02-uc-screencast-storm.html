<h1>UC: Screencast Storm</h1>
<p>2006-05-02 21:18:40 GMT</p>
<p>I've just made a couple of <a href="http://ultimatecommander.org/Screenshots">screencasts</a> demoing the most recently implemented features of UC.  I'm pretty satisfied with them.</p>
<p>If you've made some screencasts too, I'd be very glad if you could share them with the public.  Either upload them to your site and give me the URL or send them to me so I can upload them.  You may want to look up <a href="http://monda.hu/blog/2006/03/01/making-flash-screencasts-under-gnome/">my guide</a> on how to set up your environment optimally for screencasting.  As a last note on optimal resolution, it should be 896Ã—672, but not bigger under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Here's a nice shot featuring the new, revamped GUI:</p>
