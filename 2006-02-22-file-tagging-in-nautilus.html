<h1>File Tagging in Nautilus</h1>

<p>Nautilus seems to soon have a nice <a href="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=155" title="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=155">file tagging interface</a>.  I'd haven't even thought of this kind of interface, but I'm really impressed by it.  It's an awesome design in overall, even if it provides limited possibilities semantically.</p>
