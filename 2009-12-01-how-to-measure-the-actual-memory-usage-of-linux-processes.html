<h1>How to measure the actual memory usage of Linux processes</h1>

<p>This is a much harder question than one might think as VSZ and RSS are not accurate.Â  /proc/{PID}/smaps provides the most accurate information as of Linux 2.6.16.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/scripts/ps_mem.py">ps_mem.py</a> is a nice script that summarizes smaps information on a per application basis and gracefully falls back to measure VSZ when no smaps support is found.</p>
