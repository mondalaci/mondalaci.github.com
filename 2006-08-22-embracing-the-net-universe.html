<h1>Embracing the .NET Universe</h1>
<p>2006-08-21 23:53:07 GMT</p>
<p>I felt that I didn't know very much .NET and C# so made my exploration and I want to share some gems that I found and some general resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/programming/videos/" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/programming/videos/">C# Programming Videos</a>: Lots of cool interviews with the authors of the C# language.  Gave me a pretty good insight on the way they think.  I think they are very experienced language designers who did a great job with C#.</li>
<li><a href="http://mono-project.com/CSharp_Compiler" title="http://mono-project.com/CSharp_Compiler">MonoProject.com: CSharp Compiler</a>: You can read here about the new C# 2.0 language features.  I find most of them pretty useless, but there are some features like generics and anonymous methods that seem very nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://mono-project.com/Responsive_Applications" title="http://mono-project.com/Responsive_Applications">MonoProject.com: Responsive Applications</a></li>
</ul>
