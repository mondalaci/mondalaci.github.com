<h1>The Easiest to Remember DNS and HTTP server IPs</h1>
<p>2008-03-01 23:54:28 GMT</p>
<p>My sister's box, Slimmy had some nasty domain name resolution problems in the past days, weeks.  I won't go into the usual problem discovery and recovery procedure, I'd rather give you the easiest to remember name server and web server IP addresses to solve such problems virtually effortlessly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest to remember DNS server IP is 4.2.2.2</li>
<li>The easiest to remember HTTP server IP is 8.9.9.9</li>
</ul>
<p>I got the above DNS IP by asking on #apache about such an IP and I got the HTTP IP by doing an `nmap -p 80 1-9.1-9.1-9.1-9`.  The above IPs can change in the future, of course, but they can be pretty useful in tracking DNS errors as long as they are valid.</p>
