<h1>SPEEDLINK SL-6370-SYW Formula Laser Mouse disassembly</h1>

<p>This is my sister's mouse.  Its killer feature is the apparent cable retraction mechanism which I've successfully destroyed during the disassembly.  If you disassemble the retraction mechanism and aren't careful enough and apply to much force then you'll also break it so be gentle.  Apart from that, this is a pretty ordinary mouse.  The rather long distance in which the sensor detects motion is a bit disturbing me.  The microswitches are not made by Omron and I don't really think they are top-notch quality.  The one-sided PCB is a good cost saving option.</p>
<p>I'm sorry Eszter.  I will make it up, I promise.</p>
