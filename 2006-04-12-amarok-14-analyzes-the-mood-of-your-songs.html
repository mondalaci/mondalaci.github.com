<p>I'm pretty fascinated with the <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1144660487/" title="http://dot.kde.org/1144660487/">amaroK moodbar</a>.  Haven't tried it yet, but sounds interesting.  You gotta also check out the screenshot, as it looks pretty cool.</p>
<p>I cannot agree with the statement in the article that amaroK is the best audio player out there, because I don't like its interface that much.  My favourite audio player is <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox" title="http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox">Rhythmbox</a>.  Its not so polished as <a href="http://banshee-project.org" title="http://banshee-project.org">Banshee</a>, but Rhythmbox can play radio streams which is a must for me.</p>
