<h1>Me Featured in Fauna Gallery</h1>
<p>2007-07-25 01:13:00 GMT</p>
<p>I was at the <a title="http://www.balatonefestival.hu/index_eng.php" href="http://www.balatonefestival.hu/index_eng.php">BalaTone-Festival</a> last weekend where the <a title="http://www.fauna.hu/en/index.html" href="http://www.fauna.hu/en/index.html">Fauna Association</a> was present.  They protect animal rights which is a very important thing in my opinion.  I helped him in their campaign by being a poor chicken for a minute who grown up in factory farming.  I have a sad look on the picture because I'm a poor chicken.  The bubble says: Don't screw with chicken!</p>
