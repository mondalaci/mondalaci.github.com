<h1>Stumbling upon Stumbleupon</h1>
<p>2004-11-02 10:29:09 GMT</p>
<p>I've browsed through every interesting <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">Stubleupon</a> <a href="http://group.stumbleupon.com/">groups</a> that exists which is a looong job.  There are probably several hundreads of them.  Yeah, I'm surely a maniac.  So let's see the interesting stuff I found here:</p>
<ul>
<li>EBay is a complete <a href="http://weird-ebay-sales.group.stumbleupon.com/">freakshow</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/">The Best Page in the Universe</a> is truly an original site which I found from <a href="http://real-men-club.group.stumbleupon.com/">The Real Men Club</a>.  It's a power house of arrogant humor.</li>
<li><a href="http://swearing.group.stumbleupon.com/">Swearing</a> is popular.  This group has some <a href="http://swearing.group.stumbleupon.com/forum/290/">nifty thread</a>s.  The <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com">Urban Dictionary</a> is also a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuck&#038;r=f">useful resource</a>.  Likewise the <a href="http://www.notam02.no/~hcholm/altlang/">The Alternative Dictionaries</a> where I found some expressions in my native language I didn't know about.  Am I maybe some kind of a dork?</li>
<li>Some <a href="http://fractal-viewing.group.stumbleupon.com/">really nice fractals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now comes the part I almost couldn't believe: the <a href="http://personality.group.stumbleupon.com/">Personality Group</a> page.</p>
<p>I've done a <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">Jung Typology Test</a> which is a personality test.  It basically puts you into one category out of sixteen.  At first it sounds kinda lame like some horoscope stuff you may think.  I turned out to be an INTJ which stands for Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging.  More specifically by the test I am 22% introverted, 33% intuitive, 44% thinking and 33% judging.  You can find the INTJ personality analysis writings <a href="http://keirsey.com/personality/ntij.html">here</a>, <a href="http://typelogic.com/intj.html">here</a> and <a href="http://intj.group.stumbleupon.com/">here</a>.  It's so damn exciting because it's all me.  These descriptions are so deep, insightful and true.  This way I can understand myself better.  Interesting stuff.</p>
<p>But it's already 04:16 and I should really get some sleep so good night everyone.</p>
