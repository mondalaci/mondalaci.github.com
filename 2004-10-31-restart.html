<h1>(Re)start</h1>

<p>Let me write a short introduction for my blog.  I started blogging several months ago.  I saw as blogging spread over the Net and I thought I have some thoughts to share and it's also a fun activity so I started on <a href="http://blogger.hu">Blogger</a> because that was pretty popular.  Later I realized how inconvinient was using it, and I've changed to something more usable so here I am.</p>
<p>I'll write about the topics that interest me the most, that are computing, especially free software, the desktop.  You can visit my <a href="http://mondalaci.objectis.net">home page</a> for more info about me.</p>
<p>I had a previous post on Firefox which I won't import here.  I'll write about it later.</p>
<p><b>Using WordPress</b></p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> seems to be pretty enough to use it.  The admin interface is overstyled but the frontend part is now clean enough as I applied the Simple Blue theme.  It's a shame that this baby doesn't have any wikiish markup, its parser almost only autoparagraphs HTML.</p>
<p><b>About Blogger</b></p>
<p>Blogger was a nightmare.  In case somebody doesn't know (I didn't) it's basically a generator.  It runs on blogger.com.  The user logs in and makes some posts.  The posts are stored in blogger.com's database and the users can publish them.  In the user preferences one can set his/her (S)FTP account so blogger will be able to write the generated code to that location.  Once you wanna publish your post you'll have to wait up to some minutes which is a real pain in the ass.  Unfortunately that's the better case.  The worse is that you get some inscrutable error messages which truly mean that the server is so messed up that you should wait some days until the problem gets fixed.  Blogger has a simple template language too.  The only thing that was apparent to me that its UI is very mature and usable which is probably the result of years of development.  That's probably why it's so popular.</p>
<p><b>Home Page Moved to Objectis</b></p>
<p>I moved <a href="http://mondalaci.objectis.net">my home page</a> from <a href="http://sf.net/projects/rustic">Rustic</a> (pretty hardly usable at this point and completely undocumented) to <a href="http://plone.org">Plone 2</a> hosted by objectis.net.  <a href="http://objectis.org">Objectis</a> hosts noncommercial <a href="http://zope.org">Zope</a>, Plone, Plone 2 accounts freely.  I almost couldn't believe this can happen.  Plone 2 is pretty resource hungry so I was really suprised to see there is some free hosting when I googled for it.  This service is great.  The admins are very helpful and the servers are *fast*.  I hope it'll last forever.  I love Plone, especially its wiki-style markup (<a href="http://sf.net/projects/wikipedia">MediaWiki</a> has better), its OO paradigm and architecture (<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and Zope rocks).  Authoring is a magic this way.</p>
<p><b>Browsing in the Desktop World</b></p>
<p>I was browsing around the most recent developments in the free desktop world.  There are some very exciting things going on.  The most remarkable is the <a href="http://www.nat.org/dashboard">Dashboard</a> project and the infrastructure it is based on, most notably <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a>.  There is so large space to innovate.  Computers throw away so much valuable metadata.  I'm really excited about all this stuff.  I wanna work on this and use it, but unfortunately I've got some other things to do until that.</p>
<p><b>Planet Universe</b></p>
<p>I didn't knew about the <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">Planet universe</a> until this time.  This nifty feed aggregator, PlanetPlanet drives dozens of (for the present mostly technical) sites.  It's amazing to see me how a single application can change the way information is distributed.  I've tried it out myself.  The summarized page looks poorer than the posts, because the original subtle formatting gets lost, but it's still very usable anyway.  Good stuff.</p>
