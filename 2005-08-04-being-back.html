<h1>Being Back</h1>
<p>2005-08-04 18:56:27 GMT</p>
<p>I'm back again.  I've been on holiday to Italy and my family and I've been moving to Harta so that's why I haven't blogged for a while.</p>
<p>I'll probably blog less in the future.  I don't wanna be locked into the cyberspace anymore but to open to the real world and live a happier, not-so-geekish life.</p>
