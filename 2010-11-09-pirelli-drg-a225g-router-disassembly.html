<h1>Pirelli DRG A225G Router disassembly</h1>
<p>2010-11-09 22:45:16 GMT</p>
<p>This is the home gateway given by my ISP, T-Home Hungary.  Despite of this, I was determined enough to disassemble this device and hopefully they won't know about it or else I'll be screwed.</p>
<p>As you can see it's loaded with stuff.  As for its purpose, it's supposed to be a router plus a voice-over-IP gateway.  Bonus points for the wifi chip being featured on a Mini PCI card.  I have only used this beast for a short while before switching to my beloved ASUS WL500GPV2 loaded with OpenWrt.</p>
