<h1>I won't ever buy a music album</h1>

<p>I've just bought two pendrives.  There is a shiny decal on them with the title "artisjus" in their center.  Seems like I've just payed their tax, so thanks for remembering me.  (In case you don't know, artisjus is the Hungarian equivalent of the RIAA.)</p>
<p>Do you expect me to buy any music albums after such an incident?  Go figure.</p>

So I don't buy anymore musics or films, since I've already paid all of them for the next 100 years.</p>
