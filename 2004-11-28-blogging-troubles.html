<h1>Blogging Troubles</h1>
<p>2004-11-28 21:30:52 GMT</p>
<p>I couldn't blog in the past few weeks since the sysadmins of this public server were busy with architectural changes which resulted in URL semantic changes and other undesirable kind of changes as well.  I couldn't login into Wordpress anymore.  I didn't investigate the reason behind it cause I hadn't that much time.  I've just finished reinstalling and partly reconfiguring Wordpress and importing all the blog entries I've made.  It's not funny at all, believe me.  Next time I'll probably kill them.</p>
<p>Interestingly one can still see the effect of the above mentioned URL changes.  The blog URL is pretty messed up.  The server replaced the ~laci part with %7Elaci.  It's ugly like hell.</p>
<p>I've just visited <a href="http://alexking.org">Alex King's site</a> because of this pretty, clean Simple Blue Wordpress theme I'm currently using.  This site is a very nice piece of work.</p>
