<p><a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/fork-benchmark">Fork benchmark</a> is a primitive benchmark that provides a way to measure the time that is required to fork, exec and destroy x processes, where you can define x as the command line argument. I was wondering why init is so slow. Hint: It's not because forks slow, but but because init runs the services scripts sequantially, not in parallel. Fork benchmark is a C utility.</p>
