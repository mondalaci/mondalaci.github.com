<h1>The Vanished Preview Frame</h1>
<p>2007-05-22 23:18:42 GMT</p>
<p>In WordPress 2.1 there was a UI element on the post page called the preview frame.  This was basically an iframe that let you preview your post right on the post page.  It was very convenient and I used it every time.  Shockingly upon upgrading to WordPress 2.2 I couldn't find it.  I was being told on #wordpress that it was removed in WordPress 2.2.</p>
<p>I didn't understand why it was removed so I <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-May/012790.html" title="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-May/012790.html">asked</a> developers on the mailing list.  I managed to start a long <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-May/thread.html#12790" title="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-May/thread.html#12790">thread</a> about the issue.  I realized that the preview frame was rather disturbing for most folks.  Fortunately my issue <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-May/012827.html" title="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-May/012827.html">got solved</a> by the extraordinary <a href="http://robm.me.uk" title="http://robm.me.uk">Rob Miller</a> in the form of a nifty <a href="http://robm.me.uk/2007/05/22/preview-frame" title="http://robm.me.uk/2007/05/22/preview-frame">plugin</a> that implements the preview frame.</p>
<p>Thank you very much Rob!  You've made my life easier.</p>
