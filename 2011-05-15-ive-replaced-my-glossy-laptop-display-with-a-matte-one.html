<h1>I've replaced my glossy laptop display with a matte one!</h1>

<p>I'm definitely not a fan a fan of glossy displays.  Unfortunately, glossy screens heavily dominate the market nowadays which is a pain in my ass because it's a not pleasant experience to work with them in bright sunlight.  Always working in the dark room is something I was fed up with.  I've always wanted a laptop with a matte screen but given the many requirements that I have for laptops that was pretty much impossible and I finally bought my Acer Aspire 8935G-874G100BN laptop about one and half year ago featuring a big ass 18.4 glossy screen.</p>
<p>A while ago I started taking getting a matte screen more seriously and visited the largest laptop shop in my city, Szeged.  They let me know that a replacement screen would cost me a small fortune and they eventually concluded that it's not possible for me to get a matte screen.  I don't blame those guys because doing such a replacement is a rare feat and not so obvious.</p>
<p>I wasn't about to give up and <a href="http://www.overclock.net/laptops-netbooks/986389-replacing-glossy-screen-my-laptop-matte.html">asked for advice</a>.  From this point on, there was no going back.  After I disassembled my laptop and got to know that my screen is the <a href="http://www.notebook-lcd.ru/pdf/N184H6_L02.pdf">N184H6-L02 Rev. C1</a> model, I was searching for suppliers of the matte version of this screen.  Interestingly enough despite some suppliers indicate on the product page a glossy screen, they can provide you a matte version of the same model.  Fortunately, <a href="http://www.blisscomputers.net/">Bliss Computers</a> had a last matte model on their stock which I've ordered from them and it arrived to me about one week later.</p>
<p>The replacement procedure is pretty obvious, except one thing.  There's a glossy sheet that is part of the case in front of the actual glossy screen.  That sheet has to leave forever if you wanna have a matte experience.  Removing the sheet involves removing the glue that holds it there and without the sheet the assembled laptop will have a somewhat half-finished, DIY look but nothing too obtrusive.</p>
<p>Enough of words, let the images speak for themselves.</p>

<p>As a final word you may ask whether it was worth paying $115 + $45 shipping for the alternative screen.  My answer is that IT WAS A F*CKING BARGAIN!  My user experience is so much better this way that I can hardly describe it using words!  Some folks say that glossy screens provide sharper contrast but I'm not so sure at all.  All I know is that reflection has gone, the image quality is stellar and that my glossy screen is officially for sale.</p>

I complete agree with you about matte and glossy: I've just unfortunately broken my laptop's screen, I'm thinking to replace it with a matte one. I don't know if I understood well: did you remove the glossy sheet and installed the new matte monitor, that is now without anything that covers it? thanks</p>

If I were using the protective glossy sheet the overall result would be glossy despite having a matte display.</p>

<hr>Comment written by Oblom at 2012-09-12 14:21:43 GMT:<br><p>Thanks! About the new assembly, any particular issue to carry the laptop in the case(having an unprotected LCD screen scares me a bit)??? or problems related to dust, cleanness?...</p>
