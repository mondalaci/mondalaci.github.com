<h1>Memo</h1>
<p>2006-03-25 23:37:06 GMT</p>
<p>I've decided to write my blog in a way that's very different of what I've done so far.  Instead of explaining my opinion on various subjects of computing, I'll shortly summarize the most important things in my mind, like in a memo.  The reason for this change is my lack of time.  I wanna focus more on UC and other things that interest me and blogging is too much of a burden sometimes.  That doesn't mean that I won't make any long posts about the things that I found important, of course.</p>
<p>So here's my first memo:</p>
<ul>
<li>C# versus Python: C# for anything robust, Python is for prototyping and scripting.</li>
<li>IRC is incredible.  Much faster than mailing lists.  Lots of helpful folks.  Speeds up development.  Now XChat starts with my session.</li>
<li><a href="http://kororaa.org/" title="http://kororaa.org/">Koroaa</a> blows my mind.  You gotta give XGL a try.  Insane!</li>
<li>How to learn CSS fast and well: Don't read the specs, you'll lost in the details.  Learn by <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp" title="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp">examples</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://banshee-project.org" title="http://banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> has an incredible interface.  Too bad it segfaults on my box.</li>
<li>I'll probably change to Ubuntu.  Debian isn't polished very much regarding the desktop.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love this way of blogging!  :-)</p>
