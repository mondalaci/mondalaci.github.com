<h1>Geotargeting vs HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE</h1>
<p>2008-12-05 22:38:02 GMT</p>
<p>One might ponder whether to use IP based geotargeting or the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE HTTP header to determinte what is the native language of the user.</p>
<p>I can imagine two scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Providing the user the localized version of your site</strong></p>
<p>In this case use HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.  Let me tell you why it's preferred to GeoIP targeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some countries where people speak more languages.</li>
<li>The user might be in a foreign country, but his/her language is set up in the browser.</li>
<li>GeoIP databases are usually imperfect.</li>
<li>The browser langauge settings should be correct in most cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Providing geographically relevant resources to the user</strong></p>
<p>In this case IP based geotargeting is the way to go.  You can find some free databases of inferior quality or buy commercial databases of superior quality.</p>
