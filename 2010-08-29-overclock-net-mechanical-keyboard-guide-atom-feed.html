<h1>Overclock.net Mechanical Keyboard Guide Atom Feed</h1>
<p>2010-08-29 15:58:26 GMT</p>
<p>I use RSS / atom feeds pretty much all the time to minimize information overload but the <a href="http://www.overclock.net/computer-peripherals/491752-mechanical-keyboard-guide.html">Mechanical Keyboard Guide of Overclock.net</a> doesn't make my job any easier because they don't provide any feeds and the thread moves very fast.</p>
<p>I couldn't tolerate this anymore so I've created a webscraper that provides atom feeds for this thread.  Parsing HTML into a DOM and executing XPath queries on the DOM is something that I have a vast amount experience with and this project didn't take a long time either.  I've been testing it for more than a month and it's rock solid.  The only glitch is that sometimes posts are randomized between very short time intervals which is a minor inconvenience.</p>
<p>The script below (also <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/misc/blob/master/overclock-net-webscraper.php">available on GitHub</a>) is executed on a hourly basis by cron and its content is saved to <a href="http://monda.hu/overclock-net-mech-keyboard.xml">http://monda.hu/overclock-net-mech-keyboard.xml</a></p>
