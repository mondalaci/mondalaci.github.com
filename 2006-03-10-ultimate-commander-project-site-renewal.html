<h1>Ultimate Commander: Project Site Renewal</h1>
<p>2006-03-09 23:39:26 GMT</p>
<p>I've just migrated all the content to the <a title="http://ulc.sf.net" href="http://ulc.sf.net">new project site</a> I've set up on SourceForge.  This was one of the subtasks I didn't really enjoy, because these kinds of administrations generally bore and frustrate the hell out of me.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of this job was making a customized style for MediaWiki which powers the site.  As a useful side effect, I learned CSS which I find very elegant.  I used the <a title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_user_styles#FratMan" href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_user_styles#FratMan">FratMan</a> skin as a starting point and modelled the general site layout after the <a title="http://beaglewiki.org" href="http://beaglewiki.org">Beagle Wiki</a>.  It's a really usable and simple layout.</p>
<p>I've even put up the flash screencast and all the related media to the new site.  To be honest this was the first reason I moved the site to SourceForge, because it has better bandwidth, but MediaWiki has additional virtues, of course.</p>
<p>To document my glorious deed for the future generations, here is a screenshot of the old site:</p>
<p><img src="http://monda.hu/blog/wp-content/uploads/uc-homepage-version-1.png" alt="uc-homepage-version-1" width="640" height="487" /></p>
<p>And this is the new one:</p>
<p><img src="http://monda.hu/blog/wp-content/uploads/uc-homepage-version-2.png" alt="uc-homepage-version-2" width="640" height="487" /></p>
<p>I honestly hope that you can feel the difference.  If you can't, then there is something wrong with you and you're strange and weird.</p>
