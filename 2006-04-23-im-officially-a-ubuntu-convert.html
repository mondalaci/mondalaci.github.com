<p>I'm using Ubuntu Dapper Drake for about two weeks and I'm absolutely satisfied with it.  It's probably my fourth distribution since I started fooling around with Linux back around 2000.</p>
<p>Before Ubuntu, I used Debian SID because I wanted to be on the bleeding edge.  Well, I honestly believe that Debian is a great distribution, but it has rough edges regarding the desktop.  I had many issues with it in the near past.  I couldn't use the most recent pieces of the Mono desktop universe due to many different irritating errors one can ever think of.</p>
<p>I can only suggest migrating to Dapper to anyone who want a smooth desktop with the latest goodies.  On the other hand, if you want to set up a server, use Debian Stable because the Debian folks are very concerned about security.</p>
