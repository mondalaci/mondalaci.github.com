<h1>The Earth from Above</h1>
<p>2009-06-09 02:31:18 GMT</p>
<p>I incredibly respect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_Arthus-Bertrand">Yann Arthus-Bertrand</a> because of his work to present the beauty of our planet and stand up for making the situation better regarding its most serious problems, such as climate change.Â  I've first seen The Earth from Above series on Spectrum TV.</p>
<p>It looks like there is a <a href="http://earth.google.com/intl/en/earthfromabove/">Google Earth layer</a> on his work and <a href="http://www.goodplanet.org">GoodPlanet.org</a> is a central place to raise public attention on the important issues and offer solutions.</p>
