<h1>Links for 2008-10-29</h1>
<p>2008-10-29 23:35:15 GMT</p>
<p>I read my feeds on a semi-regular basis of about two weeks.  It's a pretty intensive process because I watch about three dozen feeds, but it always pays off being well informed.</p>
<ul>
<li>SourceForge has been redesigned which is a perfect example of <a href="http://www.engfers.com/2008/10/07/case-study-poor-web-usability-and-design/" title="http://www.engfers.com/2008/10/07/case-study-poor-web-usability-and-design/">how to screw up</a> a site of great usability.  I'm astonished to see how bad it became.  I'm not a usability engineer, but it's clear to me that it's a mess and I can't believe that the largest open source software repository on Earth doesn't have any decent usability folks.</li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/1561578?pg=embed&amp;sec=1561578" title="http://vimeo.com/1561578?pg=embed&amp;sec=1561578">Ubiquity</a> looks like an extremely powerful tool for streamlining various web related tasks.  Aza Raskin basically took the core idea of Enso and transformed it to work within Firefox which makes much sense to me in a web-centric world.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000543.html" title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000543.html">How To Become a Better Programmer by Not Programming</a> - I personally code less and read more nowadays.  I also  manage the technical side of Wondeer and my management role gets stronger and stronger.  Architecting Wondeer is a pleasurable challenge, it takes different level of skills than developing small applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://blip.tv/file/319044/" title="http://blip.tv/file/319044/">How to Ignore Marketing and Become Irrelevant in Two Easy Steps</a> is one of the most interesting talks I've ever seen on the topic of brand psychology and marketing.  Did you know that it takes one generation to change people's mind about a brand that have made a terrible image?</li>
<li><a href="/blog/wp-content/i_tend_to_agree_with_the_article_http:nettuts.com_articles_10-most-sought-after-skills-in-web-development" title="i_tend_to_agree_with_the_article_http:nettuts.com_articles_10-most-sought-after-skills-in-web-development">10 Most Sought-after Skills in Web Development</a> - Good compilation!</li>
<li>It's pretty refreshing to see <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/10/21/creative-user-interface-web-design/" title="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/10/21/creative-user-interface-web-design/">truly creative designs</a>, although I think that some sacrifice usability.</li>
<li><a href="http://abock.org/2008/10/20/cross-platform-thoughts-through-the-lense-of-banshee/" title="http://abock.org/2008/10/20/cross-platform-thoughts-through-the-lense-of-banshee/">Banshee has been ported to OSX</a> and work is underways to port it to Windows.  I'm happy to hear that because there's a great potential in cross-platform Mono applications I believe.  Your application gets more popular this way, you get more contributors and your work can be enoyed by many more people.  It's also a great way to build a migration path to Linux for users.</li>
<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2008/10/07/extreme-javascript-performance" title="http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2008/10/07/extreme-javascript-performance">Extreme JavaScript Performance</a> - It seems that Chrome's V8 engine is not the fastest JavaScript engine anymore.  I'm happy to see that JavaScript gets transformed from an interpreted to a compiled language.  This will empower web developers to do computation-intensive stuff on the client side making web applications conquer the world.</li>

<p><strong>How to build extremely responsive applications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2008/10/io-in-google-chrome.html" title="http://blog.chromium.org/2008/10/io-in-google-chrome.html">All I/O happens in background threads within Chrome.</a>  I think it's the only right approach to take when building perfectly responsive applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://log.ometer.com/2008-09.html#7" title="http://log.ometer.com/2008-09.html#7">Synchronous I/O is never ok</a>, says Havoc Pennington and he's absolutely right.  Even if one uses the native VFS API of his/her beloved platform things could go wrong because not only disks are slow, but there could be various abstraction layers beneath that can slow it down further, like RAID mirroring, encrypted block devices, slow or unreliable network connections in case of networked filesystems and who knows what else.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20081013_005498.html" title="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20081013_005498.html">future is multithreaded</a> anyways so it's time to learn parallel programming on a deeper level.  I think that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_FX_Library" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_FX_Library">Parallel FX Library</a> may be the best way to do that.</li>
