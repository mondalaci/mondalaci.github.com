<h1>Acer Aspire 8935G-874G100BN laptop disassembly</h1>
<p>2010-08-29 00:57:09 GMT</p>
<p>Update (2010-04-22): I've also <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/106435362157390351263/albums/5771440830981328993">disassembled the screen</a>.</p>
<p>I've disassembled my laptop a while ago.  The CPU core temperature was pretty high, sometimes above 85 celsius.  After disassembling and dusting it the temperature dropped by 20 celsius so the operation was a huge success.  High temperature has many side effects like decreased durability, increased power consumption, lower performance and who knows what else.</p>
<p>If you decide to disassemble your laptop then I can promise you few things.  First, you'll be challenged as laptops are very highly integrated and if you're coming from the PC world you'll quickly realize that it's a completely different ballgame.  Second, it's pretty likely that you'll appreciate your laptop more as you'll be able to see the vast scale of integration and all its components.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm absolutely fascinated by the internal design of laptops.  I think these gadgets truly symbolize the level of technological advancedment that humanity has reached so far.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to detail the whole disassembly process but I've realized that it'd take too much of my time.  Despite of this I hope that you'll enjoy the show.  Let's get some popcorn and let the ultimate geek porn begin.</p>

<p>Mi a helyzet veled!<br />
Te mindent szétszedsz mostanában!A ventilátort nem ártott volna lefogni nehogy  túlpörögjön!</p>
<p>Üdv</p>

<p>Na igen, mostanság többet foglalkozok a hardverekkel, és nem csak szétszedéssel hanem tervezéssel is.  A ventillátort valóban bölcs dolog lett volna lefogni de szerencsémre semmi baja nem történt.</p>
