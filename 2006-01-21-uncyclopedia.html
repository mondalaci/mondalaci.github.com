<p><a href="http://uncyclopedia.org" title="http://uncyclopedia.org">Uncyclopedia</a> is a pure source of wisdom.  You really gotta check it out.  Let's see some parts of the <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Sex" title="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Sex">Sex</a> article:</p>
<blockquote><p>The easiest way to have sex is with a woman (if you're a man) or with a man (if you are woman). Or both (If you are Oscar Wilde). You can have sex with people of the same sex as you, but you'll be called gay, freak or sinner.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>You can also have sex with animals like: chickens, dogs, horses, Llamas and Michael Jackson. It's not recommended that you have sex with the following animals: bees, Gnu, Elephants, and Oompa Loompas.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that explains everything.</p>
