<h1>The Best Cross-Platform Disk Cataloging Application</h1>
<p>2007-02-12 22:55:33 GMT</p>
<p>I've had a hard time finding a really usable disk cataloging application that runs on Linux.  I've only used <a href="http://www.whereisit-soft.com/" title="http://www.whereisit-soft.com/">Where Is It</a>, because it was the best I knew, but unfortunately it's properietary, closed-source and runs only on Windows.  Fortunately I've successfully found a very viable and really usable alternative, <a href="http://cdcat.sourceforge.net/" title="http://cdcat.sourceforge.net/">Hyper's CdCatalog</a>.</p>
<p>This software has an exceptionally usable user interface.  Despite how rough some edges of the UI are, it is a pleasure to work with, because the overall UI is very well aligned.  I think it is a great example of how it is possible to create a spectacular application with a minimal fuss.  Its creator, Péter Deák is a fellow Hungarian developer, which makes my little heart feel even more warmth toward this piece of software.  ;-)</p>
