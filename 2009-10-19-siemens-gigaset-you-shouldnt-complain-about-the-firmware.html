<h1>Siemens Gigaset: You shouldn't complain about the firmware</h1>
<p>2009-10-19 11:07:19 GMT</p>
<p>I've tried to let the Siemens Gigaset team know about some software problems through their <a href="http://gigaset.com/shc/0,1935,hq_en_0_21633_rArNrNrNrN,00.html">customer care</a> form:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
<p>I've noticed several problems with the <span>Gigaset</span> S685 IP model which I'd<br />
like you let you know about to be able to fix them.</p>
<p>First, the messenger disconnects after about a week or inactivity.  I<br />
haven't monitored the exact timespan and it may not be a fixed<br />
timespan but it happens from time to time.  I don't know whether it's<br />
caused by the inactivity in the messenger or ISP / Jabber service<br />
outage but it's surely disturbing.  I'd expect the messenger to<br />
reconnect automatically as soon as possible without needing to<br />
explicitly restarting it on the phone.</p>
<p>The other problem is that the web administration interface of the base<br />
station is not accessible from the gateway.  I'd like to connect to<br />
the web interface through VPN from my router and it seems that it's<br />
possible to connect from every IP, except the gateway IP.</p>
<p>Please let me know whether you know about these issues and when will<br />
you fix them.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />

<p>First I specified Hungary as my country and my Hungarian email address.  They redirected my email to a Hungarian company who didn't know shit about the issue and couldn't forward it to the engineers.</p>
<p>Then I specified Germany as my country and used my GMail email address.  This time I haven't got any responses.</p>
<p>I always try to avoid buying any closed source devices exactly because of such experiences.  I needed a cordless SIP phone which supports bluetooth headsets so I haven't had much options.  Maybe a smart phone with a SIP softphone would be a better choice, but that'd be more expensive.</p>
