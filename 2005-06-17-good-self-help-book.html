<h1>Good Self Help Book</h1>
<p>2005-06-17 14:05:23 GMT</p>
<p>One of my best friends has just pointed out to a very good online <a href="http://mentalhelp.net/psyhelp/">self help</a> book.  It has got some interesting topics and statistics in it.</p>
<p><b>StrongDC++ Rulez</b></p>
<p>Are you using DC++?  It's time to upgrade to <a href="http://strongdc.berlios.de/index.php?lang=eng">StrongDC++</a>.  It's full of usable features.  The GUI is much more intuitive, supports segmented downloading, and has many more cool features.</p>
<p>It's a shame that there isn't exists a quality DC client for Linux.  Some would say Valknut is good enough.  In my expericence, it's far from the truth.</p>
