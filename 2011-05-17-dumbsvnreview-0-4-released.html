<h1>dumbsvnreview 0.4 released</h1>
<p>2011-05-17 18:25:26 GMT</p>
<p>I could simply name this release as "syntax highlighting coolness" which was really simple to implement on my part because I just had to provide Meld the correct file extensions to figure out the file format.  Apart from that, I've worked around an svn bug that provided many redundant parameters to the diff utility.</p>
<p>If you upgrade to this version, please make sure that you update your /etc/sudoers to contain the meld-wrapper script instead of meld.</p>
