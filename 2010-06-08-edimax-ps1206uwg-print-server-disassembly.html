<p>Have you ever seen a print server from the inside? Â I can appreciate its two floor design since it's very compact.</p>

Well, I guess one could easily try to use the firmware of another device.  Given that the existing firmware checks the signature of the to-be-uploaded firmware one shouldn't brick any device.</p>
