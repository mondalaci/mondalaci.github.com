<h1>Entagged History</h1>
<p>2005-10-18 17:05:40 GMT</p>
<p>As far as I know <a href="http://sf.net/projects/entagged" title="http://sf.net/projects/entagged">Entagged</a>, written by <a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net/" title="http://raphael.slinckx.net/">Raphael Slinckx</a> is the most advanced audio tag handling library that exists today.  It started out as tag editor, but its library became very powerful.  Initially it was written in Java, but <a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net/blog/index.php/2005-02-08/entagged-ported-to-c-sharp" title="http://raphael.slinckx.net/blog/index.php/2005-02-08/entagged-ported-to-c-sharp">its author later ported it to C#</a> which became <a href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/entagged-sharp/" title="http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/entagged-sharp/">entagged-sharp</a> and eventually <a href="http://www.reactivated.net/weblog/archives/2005/08/entagged-sharp-in-beagle/" title="http://www.reactivated.net/weblog/archives/2005/08/entagged-sharp-in-beagle/">it had made its way into Beagle</a>.  Unfortunately entagged-sharp currently doesn't support tag writing as entagged does, it only supports tag reading, but it's still very usable in this early stage anyway.</p>

You can learn many things about the evolution of copyright.  I should care more often about legal issues.
