<h1>The Power of Alternative Channels of Information</h1>

<p>It's fascinating how differently audio and video feels compared to plain text.  It's another spectrum of information.  Tonality, movement and gestures code a tremendous amount meaning which I really like to percieve.</p>
<p>I'm saying all this because it seems that podcasts, screencasts and videos are getting more and more popular as broadband is getting more widespread day by day.</p>
<p><a href="http://osnews.com/index.php" title="http://osnews.com/index.php">OSNews</a> has a recent podcast with the theme: "<a href="http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=13691" title="http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=13691">Are We Happier When We're Fighting?</a>".  It's about flamewars.  I like the closing though: what could be accomplished if we could work together instead of wasting our energy on arguing.  Personally I've argued a lot over the typical controversial geek topics in the past.  If I see such a thread emerging nowadays, I immediately ignore it and I try to focus to things that I can actually make difference on instead of burning my energy pointlessly.</p>
<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/" title="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> also seems to be a great resource of videos, podcasts, screencasts and photos related to Microsoft and the people working there.  Despite I don't sympathize with the company, I do believe many of these people has a lot to offer and some of them are genuine talents.</p>
<p>I've just seen the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=161254" title="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=161254">interview with Jenny Lam</a> on Channel 9.  She's an artistic type designing the UI of Vista.  This interview makes me thing about design.  Really like it.</p>
