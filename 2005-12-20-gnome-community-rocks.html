<h1>GNOME Community Rocks!</h1>
<p>2005-12-20 21:15:09 GMT</p>
<p>I've made some explorations around the blogs of the GNOME hackers in the past few days.  Many of them are really talented, active and sharp, always in the state of constant exploration.  I love that mentality!  <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~federico" title="http://primates.ximian.com/~federico">Federico Mena-Quintero</a> is especially a hardcore hacker who is working on GNOME from the beginnings and is currently doing massive performance optimizations on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://planet.gnome.org" title="http://planet.gnome.org">Planet GNOME</a> is also very active and is worth reading.</p>
