<h1>How to easily log the output of your scripts with per line timestamps</h1>
<p>2010-12-25 12:44:48 GMT</p>
<p>I've faced a number of times with this scenario: I have some scripts and I wanna log their output in a way to timestamp every lines but I don't wanna write any additional code to achieve the outcome.</p>
<p>Meet timestamper.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/mondalaci/5305788.js"></script></p>
<p>Save it as "timestamper" to a directory in your $PATH and make it executable.  Using it is a no brainer:</p>
<pre lang="bash" line="0">
./myscript 2>&1 | timestamper >> myscript.log
</pre>
<p>Could it be any simpler?  I don't think so.</p>
