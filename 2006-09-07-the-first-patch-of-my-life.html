<h1>The First Patch of My Life</h1>
<p>2006-09-07 21:12:50 GMT</p>
<p>The previous week was a notable one, since I created and sent the first patch of my life.  I wonder why it took so long to make my first patch.  Maybe I just wasn't motivated enough to contribute on this level before, hell knows.  This patch has borned out of an itch of mine as usual among developers.  I love XChat and use it on a daily basis, it even starts with my session.  However I relatively rarely use it, just when I need to answer some things or ask about an issue.  So I wanted XChat to start minimized in the tray and provide a convinient way to hide / unhide.  The latter issue wasn't as easy as it ideally could be because one had to double click with the left mouse button instead of single clicking.</p>
<p>You gotta see it to believe:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/patches/blob/master/xchat-systray-integration.patch">My patch</a> works against the <a title="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=88437" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=88437">version 2.4.5</a> of the <a title="http://www.patriziobassi.it/blight/index.php?act=Systray" href="http://www.patriziobassi.it/blight/index.php?act=Systray">XChat SysTray Integration Plugin</a>.  The maintainer of the plugin, Patrizio Bassi didn't make any promises to include my code into the project, because I implemented the button changing functionality a different way that he wanted.  He proposed a more general solution, but that would involve to much widgetry to be done with pure GTK+ in C without Glade and I didn't want to do that.  It's very exhausting to write imperative code for declarative applications especially in a low-level language like C and I don't have time for that.  I've tried to align my coding style to his style, although his seems pretty bad which he agrees with.  :-)</p>
<p>As a last note, my patch is considerably bigger than it could be.  That's because the source of the XChat Systray Integration Plugin contains mixed tabs and spaces.  That pisses me off pretty much.  I have to investigate this issue because it's a major pain in the case of many projects.</p>
