<h1>Added mass downloading feature to Album Art Downloader</h1>
<p>2010-07-29 00:10:53 GMT</p>
<p>I've had to do some album art related work and I had to write a <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/patches/blob/master/aad-fetchall.patch">patch</a> for the command line variant of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/album-art/">Album Art Downloader</a> utility.  You can also check out <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=57392&st=1400&p=716037&amp;#entry716037">the related discussion</a>.</p>
