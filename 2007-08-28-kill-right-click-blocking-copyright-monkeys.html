<p>Has it ever occured to you that you visited a site, wanted to do some mouse gestures and a nasty pop-up window said to you: "<em>This page is copyrighted.  You are not allowed to copy from my page.</em>"?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes, it's time to install <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11694" title="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11694">my Greasemonkey extension</a>.  Works well against most of such pages.</p>
