<p>It's worth listening <a href="http://www.novell.com/company/podcasts/openaudio.html" title="http://www.novell.com/company/podcasts/openaudio.html">Novell Open Audio</a>.  I've listened their first podcast several days before and these guys talk about some interesting stuff.  I realized how powerful Simias, the engine under IFolder really is.  I've also realized how little I know about HAL.</p>
<p>One can learn a lot by listening talented people in general.</p>
