<h1>Genetical Approaches</h1>
<p>2005-06-18 11:11:03 GMT</p>
<p>I've just read a nice article titled <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdpcm/is_200209/ai_ziff29462">The Programming Gene</a>.  It's about the three programming paradigms I'm interested in most: aspect-oriented programming, genetic programming and intentional programming.</p>
<p>Regarding aspect-oriented programming, <a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</a> is here for a while and I wanna play with it as soon as I can.  Python also has aspect-oriented features, so it's probably worth checking it out.</p>
<p>Genetic programming is a method which doesn't require special language features, but implementing its model in any language.</p>
<p>Intentional programming is a bit vague and conceptual yet, but one can learn many things about it by reading the fresh <a href="http://blog.intentsoft.com/">blog</a> <a href="http://intentsoft.com/">intentional software</a> has put out.  Very interesting read.  Makes one think in new perspectives.  I very dislike their way of making the source locked in an obscure proprietary format.</p>
