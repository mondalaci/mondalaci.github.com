<h1>Amarok, the Music Player</h1>

<p>This is probably the first time I use <a title="http://amarok.kde.org/" href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> with the Xine engine.  I love Gstreamer's architecture, but it isn't there yet regarding stability and performance.  I generally prefer using GNOME applications to do my tasks, but Amarok is so damn usable that it's really a surprise.  It's a very mature and usable application and I use it daily since my update to Edgy.</p>
