<h1>OpenLaszlo, the Future of RIAs?</h1>
<p>2006-07-19 00:46:32 GMT</p>
<p>Since I'm genuinely interested in future technologies, I was learning a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> and related stuff in these days.  I want to see how the evolution makes its way in the cyberspace regarding the web.  Web 2.0 seems very natural to me, because I see it as a clear advantage after the nascent web.</p>
<p>Looking further in the future, one can also see the emerge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_internet_application" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_internet_application">rich internet application</a>s.  They are particularly interesting to me because they're so capable and innovative.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLaszlo" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLaszlo">OpenLaszlo</a> seems to be the most powerful platform that could drive future RIAs.  You have to see some <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/demos" title="http://www.openlaszlo.org/demos">OpenLaszlo demos</a>, but beware, because they may seriously blow your mind.  You've been warned.</p>
<p><a href="http://pandora.com/" title="http://pandora.com/">Pandora</a> is also an OpenLaszlo application in case you didn't know.</p>
