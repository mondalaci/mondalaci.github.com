<li><a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w5mLHv0nNY&amp;NR" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w5mLHv0nNY&amp;NR">Discovering Electronic Music</a> is a fascinating movie presenting the pioneers of electronic music.  It's very interesting to watch these music geeks creating a radically new kind of music.  I'm in love with vocal trance personally.  As a side note, this movie has 3 parts in case you didn't notice.</li>
<li>The <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands">Palm Islands</a> totally amaze me.  I've just seen a documentary movie about their constuction on Discovery Channel in <a title="http://www.discoverychannel.ca/on_tv/mega_builders/" href="http://www.discoverychannel.ca/on_tv/mega_builders/">Megabuilders</a> which presented the design challenges that engineers had to face.  It was very exciting.</li>
<li>The <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakatoa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a> volcanic island had a huge explosion in 1883.  Atmospheric shock waves reverberated around the world seven times and were felt for five days.  The forces of the nature are frightful.</li>
