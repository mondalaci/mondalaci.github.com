<h1>Realizing a Better Way to Blog</h1>
<p>2005-12-09 00:01:39 GMT</p>
<p>I've just realized that I structured my blog in the wrong way.  Whenever I blogged, I intentionally made no more than one post per day and I emphasized separate topics with bold style headlines within my posts.  I felt that this was the Right Thing to do, but I didn't thought through the thing.</p>
<p>A much better way to blog is to made new posts for every topic, even if they're on the same day.  This has several advantages, namely 1) you can reference your posts without mixing topics and 2) you can set the categories of your posts separately in a more finer-grained way.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to link the shortest text that is possible in the given context.  Makes your blog clearer.</p>
