<h1>Coder Keymaps 0.4 Released</h1>
<p>2005-10-14 17:10:17 GMT</p>
<p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/coder-keymaps">Coder Keymaps</a> 0.4.  Grab it while it's fresh!  I made a new homepage for it which I think is very simple and usable.  I love PHP for these kind of simple tasks which is a strange, but warm feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Projects Updated</strong></p>
<p>I've updated <a href="http://monda.hu/projects/">my projects page</a> also.  Now it contains all the projects I've made.  Some other parts of my home page are restructured likewise to improve its usability.</p>
