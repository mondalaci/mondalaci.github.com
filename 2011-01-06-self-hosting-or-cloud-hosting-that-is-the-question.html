<h1>Self hosting or cloud hosting: that is the question</h1>

<p>I know many geeks.  Most of them are smart.  Some of them are brilliant.  Few of them are world class.  And guess what?  Many of them blog on a regular basis.  These are tech savvy folks who run their blogs on their own (or rented) server for maximum customizability and pay a monthly fee.  What do you think, how long will the information they produced survive if some of them get hit by a train?  It's very simple.  You divide the amount on their bank account with their monthly hosting fees and you got the number of months in question.</p>
<p>What I wanna ultimately conclude is that there are lots of folks who create valuable content on a daily basis and their content is way too much vulnerable.</p>
<p>I was thinking a lot about this issue.  I have 350 posts at the moment and although I know that mankind would happily survive without any of them, I feel the need to secure this information just in case.</p>
<p>Since I (and most of the people) use WordPress, I was thinking about a Wordpress specific solution.  The idea is to dump my self hosted blog to my cloud hosted WordPress.com blog on a regular basis from cron.  Of course, there are some drawbacks, like Google may find the mirrored content along or before my primary site and I won't be able to really customize the cloud hosted blog but I think that the benefits outweight the drawbacks.</p>
<p>The term I'm about to coin is the "backup blog" what is a cloud hosted blog where you mirror your content on a regular basis in an automated manner.  I'm about to do this but I'm not there yet.</p>

As you know, we wanna go big with our rehearsal place (The Sanctuary) and give webdesign, hosting and permanent storage for studio works for bands who plays at our place.<br />
And guess what: I may try out Google App Engine to build and host professional websites and applications. You can host Django or Enterprise Java on it, so virtually you can do anything.<br />
Of course you can say that GAE isn't flexible enough for a couple reasons but hey! No size fits all!</p>

We both love Python and by putting the Dreamgrave site to the Google cloud you pretty much preserve it for eternity.  I guess they provide you lots of free resources and if you ever run out of them then Dreamgrave has made it.  :)</p>
