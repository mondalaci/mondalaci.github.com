<h1>Monda.hu site improvements</h1>
<p>2008-11-14 04:58:41 GMT</p>
<p>I've made loads of improvements to monda.hu recently and I'm very excited about them!</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a completely new, shiny main page which is composed of two paragraphs, one for English and one for Hungarian.  It's maybe a bit dense, but it's certainly very informative.</li>
<li>Integrated my Google Reader shared items under the title "<a href="http://monda.hu/news" title="http://monda.hu/news">News</a>" which you can see on the top navigation bar.  I've previously blogged about the news I found interesting and I'm a bit reluctant to store my shared items in the cloud, but it's extremely productive to comment and share the news with Google Reader.  I hope I'll be able to save my shared items in the future.</li>
<li>Installed a parallel Wordpress for my new <a href="http://monda.hu/hunblog/" title="http://monda.hu/hunblog/">Hungarian blog</a> which you can also find through the above mentioned navigation bar.  It was quite a challenge as Wordpress is not designed to host parallel blogs and I didn't want to use Wordpress MU, because it seemed to me that it lags behind Wordpress.  I've succeeded to solve the problem by setting up a symlink farm and reusing the wordpress and wp-includes directores and hacking the Beeblebrox theme file to include some language translations.</li>
</ul>
