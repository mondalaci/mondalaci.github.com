<h1>nitehawk rocks the house</h1>

<p>Finally, I got my first laptop a week ago which I named nitehawk because of it's color.  It's an Acer Aspire 8935G-874G100BN and I think it pretty much represents the level of hardware integration that can be achieved in 2009.  With its 18.4-inch LED LCD screen and its load of impressive features it's almost more like a desktop than a laptop and it's exactly what I wanted because I change my location of a two weekly basis and I don't need much mobility other than that.</p>
<p>The first thing I did when nitehawk arrived is I sent it back to Acer so they could remove Windows 7 and give me back its price.  When all things summed including the traversing costs I haven't earned almost any money, but I didn't do it for the money.  This was my gentle gesture to show Redmond that they're welcomed to taste my middle finger.</p>
<p>nitehawk's keyboard is as crappy as most laptop keyboards from a typewriting point of view, but I do truly appreciate its power efficiency in overall and suspend, hibernate especially.  I carry it in a Targus TCB001EU XL notebook backpack because I couldn't get any other backpacks in Hungary that was big enough to hold this beast. :)</p>
