<h1>Bye bye Evolution</h1>
<p>2008-10-03 02:58:00 GMT</p>
<p>Update (2008-10-22): It seems like it's possible to use GPG with Firefox with <a href="http://getfiregpg.org/" title="http://getfiregpg.org/">FireGPG</a>.</p>
<p>I've officially abandoned Evolution in favor of the GMail web interface which I use in Flock using the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/15739" title="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/15739">Gmail and Google Apps Sidebar Remover</a> Greasemoney script.</p>
<p>I'd like to use GPG, but I'm fed up with Evolution.  It has a friendly and helpful community on #evolution and I appreciate their help, but the software itself is a disaster in my opinion.  It crashes twice a week, duplicates some of my emails seemingly randomly, slow to close and it's a memory hog.  I find GMail's interface much usable, it's really a pleasure to use.</p>
<p>I'll automate fetching my mails to my localhost on a regular basis, since I don't like storing important informations solely in the cloud.</p>
