<h1>Edge Detector Dude Released</h1>

<p>I've written yet another PyGTK application in the near past for the Digital Image Segmentation course of the university.</p>
<p>You ask me what it really is?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/edge-detector-dude">Edge Detector Dude</a> is a simple image manipulation application written in Python using PyGTK. It presents you the Sobel edge-detected and the gradient-directed versions of the input image. The pixels of the gradient-directed image is computed by denoting the angle of the gradient of the pixel and mapping this value as a grayscale color.</p>
<p>Edge Detector Dude is more accurately a front end that uses the accompanying gradient utility to process the input image and visualize its result images.</p>
<p>gradient is written in C using the Allegro game programming library.</p>
<p>Let's see this dude:</p>

<p>I'm proud of this GUI design because I think it's very usable, however there are several things that could be improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a "View" button to view images.  Currently the statausbar mentions that images can be viewed by double clicking on their names, but it's not very eye-catching and novices may miss it.</li>
<li>Add support for other file formats.  For some strange reason Allegro only handled BMPs, however according to the documentation it should handle a wide variety of image formats.</li>
<li>Replace the gradient-directed image with something nicer.  It's really ugly, no questions, but I had no choice because that was the exact task to be done.</li>
</ul>
