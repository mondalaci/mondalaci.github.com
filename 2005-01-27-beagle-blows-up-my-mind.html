<p><a href="http://nat.org">Nat</a> did some fascinating flash <a href="http://nat.org/demos/">demos</a> about beagle in action.  It's worth watching them.</p>
<p><b>Electra</b></p>
<p><a href="http://elektra.sourceforge.net/">Electra</a> tries to make the configuration hell disappear.  I didn't dvelve into it but I welcome the idea.  The only thing I miss is some kind of configuration change notification feature but because the lack of a daemon it's hardly possible.  Maybe GConf is indeed too heavyweight for lighter applications.</p>
<p>Newsforge has a nice article titled "<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/01/19/166244.shtml?tid=130&tid=132">Innovations in window management</a>" about guess what.</p>
