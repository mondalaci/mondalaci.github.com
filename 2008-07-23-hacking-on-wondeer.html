<h1>Hacking on Wondeer</h1>
<p>2008-07-23 22:28:05 GMT</p>
<p>I've been pretty quiet lately working on a <a href="http://wondeer.com" title="http://wondeer.com">glorious project</a> that has the potential of being the leading multimedia service on the web providing music for free and legally.  It works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>User searches for music (s)he likes.</li>
<li>User adds the desired song(s) the his/her wishlist.</li>
<li>The songs get recorded from Internet radio stations.</li>
<li>User plays the music in the flash player on the site or saves it to his/her machine in a limited number of times.</li>
</ol>
<p>The base concept is pretty simple, doing it legally and overcoming the technical challenges isn't.  I'm not your lawyer so I won't go into the legal details, although I have some level of understanding about them, but our service is completely legal as far as I know.  Unsurprisingly, I know the technicalities and I'm in charge of running and evolving our service smoothly.</p>
<p>We're using a great deal of interesting technologies, like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com" title="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) (particularly EC2, S3 and soon SQS), Mono, jQuery, MySQL and lots of others.  I won't go into great depths regarding our technical challenges because I rather don't wanna help our future competitors, but I plan to share little bits of Wondeer here in my blog especially regarding bugfixes and new features.</p>
<p>The most interesting piece of technology we use is definitely AWS.  Cloud computing has the potential of skyrocketing start-ups without paying heavy up-front costs that most people couldn't afford to start up their business.</p>
<p>Thanks for László Visnyei, my friend and collegue for dreaming the idea, gathering the team, taking care of the personal and legal issues the came up and making me see the potential of AWS.  Also thanks for Dömi, my great friend and collegue for the hard work the he's been put into this.</p>
<p>I'm feeling burnt out lately, time to go on a vacation and this is exactly what I'm about to do on the day after tomorrow.  Croatia is waiting for my friends and me, we won't resist!</p>

<hr>Comment written by <a href="http://monda.hu">Laci</a> at 2010-08-31 15:35:45 GMT:<br><p>We've had legal and funding problems and decided that it's not worth the effort anymore.  I plan to make a screencast in the near future to show off our work for future generations.  :)</p>

<hr>Comment written by Zsolt Szabo at 2010-09-01 10:07:12 GMT:<br><p>That's a pity, it seemed like a good idea from the description. I would be interested in the tech details on how the system worked on AWS, how it recorded the music, where it stored it and your point on whether AWS is a viable option for this kind of task.</p>

<hr>Comment written by <a href="http://monda.hu">Laci</a> at 2010-09-01 10:12:22 GMT:<br><p>Yeah, it was an interesting idea, too bad it had legal problems.  As for the technical explanation, I'll happily put together a blog post in the near future describing it along with a screencast.  I have your email, I'll let you know.  AWS was absolutely viable for Wondeer by the way, but dedicated hosting solutions may be cheaper in the long run.</p>
