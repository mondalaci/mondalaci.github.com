<p>This question puzzled me for a while.  It turned out that the WordPress RSS widget <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12790">uses the link element</a> of the atom feed it gets to link the header of the widget.  The problem is that the Google Reader atom feed <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader/thread?tid=14146700189bc883&hl=en">doesn't have such an element</a>.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to use Yahoo Pipes which failed to solve this problem so I've written a handy little script.</p>
