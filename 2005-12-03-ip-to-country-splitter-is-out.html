<h1>IP to Country Splitter is Out</h1>
<p>2005-12-02 23:56:34 GMT</p>
<p>I've just released <a title="http://mondalaci.objectis.net/projects" href="http://monda.hu/blog/wp-content/uploads/ip-to-country-splitter.tar.bz2">IP to Country Splitter</a> which provides you a way to integrate the IP address to Country lookup feature very easily into your PHP application.  I didn't give it a version number intentionally since I don't really wanna maintain it in the future and it's fairly usable at this point.  At least I hope.</p>

<p><strong>My Scripts are Refreshed</strong></p>
<p>I've also released the most recent version of <a title="http://mondalaci.objectis.net/projects/scripts" href="http://mondalaci.objectis.net/projects/scripts">my scripts</a>.  You'll find it interesting if you're interested in streamlining HTTP transactions.  monda.py now contains a class, named Surfy.  As its name suggest it's a browser class, which can be your best friend in some scenarios.</p>
