<h1>Being Free Again</h1>
<p>2006-06-17 08:12:11 GMT</p>
<p>I'm so glad because I've finally succeeded with my exams for this semester.  The last one was a nasty fucker.</p>
<p>I wanna hack on UC, hardcore.  I've updated the <a href="http://ultimatecommander.org/Project_Roadmap" title="http://ultimatecommander.org/Project_Roadmap">Project Roadmap</a> in the near past so there's a pretty good vision where the project should be moving.  I have to make a couple little changes on the MediaWiki home page skin.  After that, I have to implement a custom TreeModel interface for the panel, so it could display files much more faster.  It seems that it's the only way to speed it up, I've basically tried everything else.  I also feel a strong urge to move to Stetic, in MonoDevelop, because messed up Glade signals are cumbersome to handle.</p>
<p>I wanna also find some nice telejob(s) to make some money, because currently, I'm a poor bastard.</p>
