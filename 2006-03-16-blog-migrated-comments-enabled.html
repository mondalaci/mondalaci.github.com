<h1>Blog Migrated, Comments Enabled</h1>
<p>2006-03-16 01:26:29 GMT</p>
<p>If you can read this, that means that I've successfully migrated my blog to the new server and redirected the related URLs carefully.  I've also upgraded to the most recent WordPress and I'm absolutely amazed by the richness of the admin UI.  These guys are pushing JavaScript to its limits.</p>
<p>There are many advantages of this move, such as better response time, speed and wider administration possibilities.  Abusing the power of .htaccess belongs to the latter category.  I love the permament URIs WordPress provides this way.</p>
<p>The most apparent blog change I've made is finally enabling the comments.  Comments were disabled for a while in my blog because of the massive amounts of comment spam I got, but there is a great way to evade them.  This method is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a> and it's wonderfully simple and effective.  There are more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Spam_Tools#Captcha" title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Spam_Tools#Captcha">WordPress CAPTCHA plugins</a>, but most of them are crap.  Fortunately there is a real gem among them, the <a href="http://www.boriel.com/?page_id=17" title="http://www.boriel.com/?page_id=17">Capcha! plugin</a>.  You gotta try it if you wanna communicate through your blog without being flooded with spam.</p>
