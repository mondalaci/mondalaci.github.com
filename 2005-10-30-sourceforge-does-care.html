<h1>SourceForge Does Care!</h1>

<p>I <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=718346&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=350001" title="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=718346&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=350001">opened</a> a support ticket on SourceForge on 2003-04-09.  I asked them to create a new Trove category, called "File Managing" (yeah, my English sucks) or something like that.  No relevant reply was made then and I also felt a bit stupid for bothering them with such an issue.  Feeling stupid was definetly because of my low self-confidence at that time by the way.</p>
<p>I haven't tracked this ticket and only now, when I changed the project infos of <a href="http://sf.net/projects/ulc" title="http://sf.net/projects/ulc">Ultimate Commander</a>, I noticed the entry "Topic :: System :: File Management" and I went after that.  They closed my ticket and included my category on 2005-01-05!</p>
<p>It's the most exciting in the open development model.  Every single individual can change this universe.  174 projects have <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=601" title="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=601">registered themselves</a> in my category so far.</p>
