<h1>Goodbye Feedy, Greetings Google Reader!</h1>
<p>2007-07-26 21:29:01 GMT</p>
<p>I've recently trashed my feed reader, Feedy.  I started it about a half year ago, but it took too much time to maintain it.  I knew about Google Reader for a long time, but I didn't like it's interface.  Now that I use it for two weeks I have no doubts about its superior usability.  I'm very satisfied with it.</p>
<p>Although I doubt anyone would use Feedy, I put it out, because I think it has a nice UI and a good database layout that prevents feed duplication pretty effectively so it may be a good base for developing a more robust feed reader.</p>
<p><a title="feedy.tar.bz2" href="http://monda.hu/blog/wp-content/uploads/feedy.tar.bz2">feedy.tar.bz2</a> is not a release.  A release is a carefully put together end product that is easy to install.  Feedy is not easy to install, but check out the README file for some information.</p>
<p>Lastly but not leastly here are some screenshots:</p>
