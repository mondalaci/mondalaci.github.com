<h1>Goodbye Tiger!</h1>
<p>2007-02-12 22:01:41 GMT</p>
<p>Tiger, the beloved cat of my family has passed out last week.  His death came very suddenly, no one of us expected it to happen.  Tiger has survived quite a lot of things.  He has been hit by a car, beaten up pretty badly, and has gotten an ugly virus which almost killed him last year.  The odd thing is, we don't know what happened to him this time.  <a title="http://klara.monda.hu" href="http://klara.monda.hu">My mother</a> found him lying on the floor.  By that time he was already dead.  Maybe he ate something ugly.  No one knows.</p>

<p>Goodbye Tiger!  Have a good time in the kitty heaven!  We will always remember you!</p>
