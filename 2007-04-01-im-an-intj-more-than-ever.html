<h1>I'm an INTJ More than Ever</h1>
<p>2007-04-01 19:30:35 GMT</p>
<p>I've just redone the <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm" title="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">Jung Typology Test</a> yesterday and it turned out that my preferences regarding my Myers-Briggs type are <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/vocation/JCI.asp?EI=-56&amp;SN=-50&amp;TF=50&amp;JP=56" title="http://www.humanmetrics.com/vocation/JCI.asp?EI=-56&amp;SN=-50&amp;TF=50&amp;JP=56">considerably stronger</a> than <a href="http://laci.monda.hu/blog/2004/11/02/stumbling-upon-stumbleupon/" title="http://laci.monda.hu/blog/2004/11/02/stumbling-upon-stumbleupon/">one and half years ago</a>.  I think I've matured since than and I know myself better so my answers reflect my personality better this time.  I think the MBTI is a very good way of modelling people's personalities.</p>
<p>Based on my results, I chose the right profession.  Good to know that.  ;)</p>
