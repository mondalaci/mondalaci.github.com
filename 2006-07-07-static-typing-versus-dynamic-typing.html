<h1>Static Typing versus Dynamic Typing</h1>
<p>2006-07-07 13:45:03 GMT</p>
<p>I used to be a big believer of dynamically typed languages, especially Python.  While I do think Python is great, I think C#, Java and well designed statically typed languages are better suited for large scale applications.  Whatever the case is, I found two good resources on the topic on Wikipedia, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Type System article</a> and another article titled <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/strong-weak-typing.html" title="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/strong-weak-typing.html">Is Weak Typing Strong Enough</a> on Stevey's Home Page.</p>
