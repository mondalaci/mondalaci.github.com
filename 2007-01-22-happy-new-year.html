<h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
<p>2007-01-21 23:51:52 GMT</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I've posted anything.  A year gone by since then.  Reflecting back to 2006, it was a pretty satisfiying year.  I've learned a lot of things, got to know some really great people.</p>
<p>My new year resolution includes development regarding my personal life.  My career, my relationships, being a better man, being more giving.  I will be more and better day by day, living a life that I truly enjoy.  A life that makes me happy in a way of not hurting everyone, but making the world a better place.  I truly believe I can make this happen.</p>
<p>I am grateful for everything I have and everything I've achieved in 2006 even if I seem dissatisfied sometimes, because I always strive for more.  I wish everyone an awesome 2007 and a happy life in general.  I think we can build a great life by looking deep inside ourselves and realize our dreams.  As a last word, despite this post may sound really new age, I truly believe it has some important things to say for everyone.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best!</p>
