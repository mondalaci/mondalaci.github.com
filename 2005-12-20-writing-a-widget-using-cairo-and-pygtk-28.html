<h1> Writing a Widget Using Cairo and PyGTK 2.8</h1>
<p>2005-12-20 22:13:52 GMT</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pygtk.org/articles/cairo-pygtk-widgets/cairo-pygtk-widgets.htm" title="http://pygtk.org/articles/cairo-pygtk-widgets/cairo-pygtk-widgets.htm">article</a> with the above title has just appeared some days ago.  <a href="http://www.cairographics.org" title="http://www.cairographics.org">Cairo</a> finally makes us able to create state-of-the-art widgets.  It reminds me of PostScript because of its vector-graphics nature, but it's not a language, but an API.</p>
<p>It has multiple backends like X surfaces, hardware accelerated OpenGL surfaces or bitmap buffers.  Very powerful.</p>
