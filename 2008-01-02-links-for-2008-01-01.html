<p>It's a stellar article on usability defects that make user's and related parties' life hell.  I was pretty conscious about all these mistakes except blaming error mesages.</p>
<p>I used a web based payment service of my ISP several months ago that asked me for the date on my last bill that I got from them.  After inputting the date in yyyy.mm.dd. format as it was present on the bill and the validation failed, I tried it without the ending dot and I succeeded.  I found 2 more similar usability errors related to their messy form and reported to them.  I got no response ever since and eventually stopped using their payment service.  They should fire their customer service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most developers don't have a clue on usability engineering and that's the reason why there are so many crappy applications, but in the above case one doesn't have to be a rocket scientist just to make such a straightforward input validation a little more flexible.  I guess most geeks prefer relating to machines more than relating to people and that's why they suck at usability.</p>

<p>It's an interesting concept that can deeply affect the evolution of our technologies.  Despite .NET coming from Microsoft, I think it's a great platform so I deliberately use Mono for various projects.  I think Miguel knew that there will be a group of people that will pretty much dislike the whole idea because of its origins from Microsoft, but he took his chance and here Mono is.  I was much more prone to Not Invented Here in the past, but I think there's really more to lose than to win if you apply it.</p>
