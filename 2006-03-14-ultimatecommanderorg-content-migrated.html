<h1>ultimatecommander.org: Content Migrated</h1>
<p>2006-03-14 16:53:01 GMT</p>
<p>I've just finished migrating all the SF project web content to <a href="http://ultimatecommander.org" title="http://ultimatecommander.org">http://ultimatecommander.org</a>.  The site is hosted by <a href="http://mediacenter.hu" title="http://mediacenter.hu">http://mediacenter.hu</a>, which seems to be a very good hosting provider regarding how much value it provides in exchange for only 120$ per year.  Project demoing flash screencasts shouldn't be slow anymore, not even from foreign countries.</p>
<p>I will migrate the whole monda.hu domain to the new server as soon as they finished setting up the DNS.  As a side effect of this, monda.hu will be offline for a while, so you may not be able to read my blog for a day or two.  I hope you can live with that.  ;-)</p>
<p>I'd like to thank my mother for financing the new hosting service and the ultimatecommander.org domain.  I don't have any jobs right now, because I decided to work on UC, gain experience, and create something really exceptional in this respect.  She's a furniture painting folk artist and you can find her home page at <a href="http://mondaklara.hu">http://mondaklara.hu</a>.</p>
