<h1>Scott Berkun, the Man</h1>
<p>2005-11-03 22:32:52 GMT</p>
<p>I heard about <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/about/" title="http://www.scottberkun.com/about/">Scott</a> first on OSNews.  There was an article about him mentioning that he left Microsoft and that he has worked on Internet Explorer in the past.  At that time I didn't really care.  I was too busy.</p>
<p>A few days ago I read some articles on OSNews and one of these was his writing, titled "<a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay46.htm" title="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay46.htm">Why software sucks (And what to do about it)</a>".  Since I'm genuinely interested in software usability I read that article.</p>
<p>It was the best article I ever read on the topic.  It makes you think in new ways in terms of philosophy, engineering and in relation to your users and yourself.  I was thinking which pieces of it should I blog on, but It'd be a sin quoting parts of it, because it makes a coherent whole that should be read by everyone interested in the topic.</p>
<p>I think I don't exaggerate if I say Scott is one of the sharpest writers that I ever had the priviliege to read from and I'm looking forward to his future <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/" title="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/">essays</a> and will definitely read some (if not all) of his older ones.</p>
