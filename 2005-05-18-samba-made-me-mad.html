<h1>Samba Made Me Mad</h1>

<p>If you ever need to mount a Samba share of a Hungarian WinXP box, don't believe to the infos on the net.  They say that you have to use</p>
<pre>
mount -t smbfs -o password=yourpassword,codepage=852,iocharset=iso8859-2 //hostname/sharename /targetdir
</pre>
<p>But they're wrong.  Maybe something has changed since then, but the correct form is now to use <code>codepage=<b>cp</b>852</code>.  Learn from other's mistakes and don't waste your time as they did.  Seriously.  It's not funny messing around with things like that.</p>
