<h1>Being Busy</h1>
<p>2005-02-12 11:45:46 GMT</p>
<p>I've currently got two (paying) jobs so I don't have really much time to blog.  I cannot tell much about the first because it is confident, but it's a central system application, a GUI frontend for a Linux distribution, written in Python, using PyGTK.  The other is implementing various pieces of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cfo.html">code factoring algorighms</a> in GCC that reduce code size at the <a href="http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/tanszekek/szoftverfejlesztes/starten.xml">Department of Software Engineering of the University of Szeged</a>.  Interesting stuff.</p>
