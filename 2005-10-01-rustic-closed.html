<h1>Rustic Closed</h1>
<p>2005-10-01 15:30:58 GMT</p>
<p>I have just marked <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rustic" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rustic">Rustic</a> inactive.  It was my second project on SourceForge.  I wanted to have a home page that is very easy to use and navigate and that is very simple also.  I made a simple engine based on the design of <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">ESR's home page</a> of that time.  It had a header, a footer, every page had a description string and it also had a sitemap feature.</p>
<p>I've made something workable, but I was very inexperienced at that time and I haven't thought of many important aspects of the problem.  I think the most relevant ones by importance are 1) editing throught the web, 2) a powerful authoring (wiki) language and 3) slim design.</p>
<p>Fortunately DokuWiki fulfills all my expectations.  It complies with all the above points and doesn't force a strict structure like many CMSes, but freely allows one to arbitrary interlink the wiki namespace.</p>
<p>You can read more on installing DokuWiki for this purpose in one of my earlier blog entries, <a href="http://monda.hu/~laci/blog/index.php?p=39" title="http://monda.hu/~laci/blog/index.php?p=39">DokuWiki Adventures</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stupid Favicon!</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a> for your site?  I did and it really exhausted me.  That's because for some stupid reason (the Windows version of) Firefox behaved strange.  When I named the icon file the standard way <code>favicon.ico</code> and referenced to it from the HTML using the <code>link</code> tag, the following has happened:</p>
<p>I enter the address into Firefox and at the left side of the location bar the favicon is there.  However I cannot see it on the tab of this page.  Switching to another tab and switching back makes the favicon compeletly disappear even from the location bar.</p>
<p>So what did I?  I renamed <code>favicon.ico</code> to <code>monda.ico</code>, modified the HTML reference  and it worked magically.  I'm using Firefox 1.0.   it's maybe a stupid bug, but the thing I don't understand is that most sites use the standard <code>favicon.ico</code> filename and they do work.  So what the hell is going on?</p>
