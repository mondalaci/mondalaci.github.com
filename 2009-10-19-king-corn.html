<h1>King Corn</h1>

<p>I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Corn_(film)">the above mentioned movie</a> about two months ago and it had a profound effect on me.Â  If you wanna know why is there corn in our hair, how is it possible that we spend half of the money for food as our ancestors and why diabetes rised dramatically during the last decades then you should watch this movie.</p>
<p>The creators of this movie were inspired by the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a> who seems to be a very wise man and I want to read some of his books in the future.</p>
