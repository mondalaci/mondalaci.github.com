<h1>MediaWiki on SourceForge, Part 2</h1>
<p>2005-12-09 00:25:53 GMT</p>
<p>In a previous post of mine, "<a href="/~laci/blog/index.php?p=62" title="/~laci/blog/index.php?p=62">MediaWiki on SourceForge</a>", I wrote about the topic of this post and this time I wanna correct the informations I gave there.</p>
<p>Diego Torres Milano, developer of the <a href="http://jglade.sourceforge.net/" title="http://jglade.sourceforge.net/">JGlade</a> project contacted me several days ago that I should update my blog mentioning that MediaWiki cannot be installed on SourceForge.  He kindly pointed out to his <a href="http://jglade.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Mediawiki_installation_on_SourceForge#mediawiki-sf" title="http://jglade.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Mediawiki_installation_on_SourceForge#mediawiki-sf">script</a> which is meant to install MediaWiki on SourceForge.</p>
<p>I couldn't use his script, because it seemed a bit buggy, I haven't had the time and I'm not so motivated installing MediaWiki on SourceForge right now since I'm using DokuWiki on monda.hu for <a href="/projects/uc" title="/projects/uc">Ultimate Commander</a>.  I recommended him to write a howto on the topic since the suckiness of bash scripts in these complex scenarios is unavoidable, but he thinks a script is a better way to do the thing.</p>
<p>He told me that SourceForge allows to write the <code>/tmp/persistent/</code> directory.  You typically wanna create your <code>/tmp/persistent/&lt;your-project&gt;</code> directory and put the related files into it.  This way one can install any web application on SourceForge.</p>
<p>Anyways, I you wanna install MediaWiki on SourceForge you should really give his script a try.  He's also helpful and very willing to improve his script so contact him if things don't go well.</p>
<p>Thanks Diego.</p>
