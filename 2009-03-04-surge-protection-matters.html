<h1>Surge protection matters</h1>
<p>2009-03-03 23:26:08 GMT</p>
<p>I used to worry about power surges, but not anymore.  I've recently bought a <a title="http://catalog.belkin.com/PureAV.process?Section_Id=202496" href="http://catalog.belkin.com/PureAV.process?Section_Id=202496">PureAV surge protector</a> from Belkin.  They pay all your losses in case something bad happens.  The technology seems <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_protector" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_protector">very mature</a>, I sleep calmly from now on.</p>
