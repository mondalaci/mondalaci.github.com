<h1>Joe Grand is my hero</h1>
<p>2009-12-19 18:57:01 GMT</p>
<p>About a year ago I became involved in electronics.  This was because the development of the Ultimate Keyboard requires strong electronics knowledge and not only I couldn't hire anybody (without the resources doing so), but I also wanted to understand electronics and over time as I read the articles on <a href="http://hackaday.com/">Hack a Day</a> I realized how cool electronics really is.</p>
<p>I've been doing software development for a few years and it's always fun, but doing purely software development in itself is not that interesting for me as it used to be.  We have a keyboard, a mouse and a monitor, that's mildly interesting.  We also have the Internet for several years which is much more interesting.  What if create a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6JnAxTXApw&feature=related">propeller clock</a>, a line <a href="http://elm-chan.org/works/ltc/report.html">following robot</a> or <a href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/prototype-this/">all kinds of ultra-crazy stuff</a>, both the hardware and software?  That sounds to me like the ultimate fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Grand">Joe Grand</a> is probably the most well-known hardware hacker who became famous as one of the hosts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_This!">Prototype This</a>.  He is a really cool guy and has tons of interesting materials on <a href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/">his site</a>.  I'm grateful for every piece of knowledge that I can learn from guys like him.</p>
