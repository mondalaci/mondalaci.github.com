<h1>I Don't Need No Fucking Education!</h1>

<p>I truly fucking hate the university.  This is a place where you have to learn some massive amount of shit in order to get a piece of paper which some employers attribute as a sign of competence and/or basic intelligence.  Actually, it's more of a sign of being able to suffer by a bunch of idiots, torturing you with their evil exercises that you'll never make any use of in your entire life.</p>
<p>I have to make this exam down.  Shit!</p>
