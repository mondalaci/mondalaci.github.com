<h1>WordPress Comment Counter Hell</h1>
<p>2006-12-02 17:24:13 GMT</p>
<p>The comment counters of my articles have been messed up.  I've noticed this thing several months ago and it's probably related to WordPress updates.  I set the counters manually within phpMyAdmin for the first time it happened, but I got pretty pissed off when it already happened later so I decided to fix this mess.  I've googled around for the solution and found a <a href="http://rawlinson.us/blog/?p=431" title="http://rawlinson.us/blog/?p=431">pretty good script</a> to solve the problem which was a bit buggy and incomplete, so I fixed it.</p>
<p>Here you are:</p>

<p>You can fetch it <a href="http://monda.hu/blog/wp-content/uploads/fix-comment-count.txt" title="fix-comment-count.txt">here</a>.  Just copy it to your "<code>wp-admin</code>" directory and point your browser to its URL.</p>
