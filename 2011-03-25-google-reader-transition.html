<h1>Google Reader transition</h1>
<p>2011-03-25 19:14:49 GMT</p>
<p>I've been using Google Apps for a while and a transition opportunity has appeared lately on the Google Apps admin interface that I've just executed.  As a result I can use Reader through my Apps account instead of my Gmail account and my shared items page has changed from the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/04674577121720532529">old page</a> to the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/16423546940447935835">new page</a>.</p>
<p>According to the statistics I've read 86,937 items since April 7, 2006 with my old account which seems like a lot.</p>
