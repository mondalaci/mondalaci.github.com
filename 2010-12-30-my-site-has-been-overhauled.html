<h1>My site has been overhauled</h1>
<p>2010-12-30 16:52:33 GMT</p>
<p>I've overhauled my site during the recent monts.  The things I've done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrated every MediaWiki page to WordPress and shut down MediaWiki.</li>
<li>Migrated every image to Flickr.</li>
<li>Moved every useful project to the cloud, primarily to Google Code due to its simplicity.</li>
<li>Cleaned up my project page and included my smaller projects.</li>
<li>Overhauled the main page.</li>
<li>Updated the categories.</li>
<li>Moved my CV to LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Made every page 100% XHTML Transitional complicant.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been a major update that I wanted do to a long time ago but never had the time.  I also have some small plans regarding improving the performance of my site.  I wanna use a PHP opcode cache, make an image sprite from the theme images and serve static content using lighty from a separate subdomain.  None of these is urgent but I want my site to be lightning fast eventually.</p>
