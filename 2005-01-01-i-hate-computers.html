<h1>I Hate Computers</h1>
<p>2005-01-01 12:11:06 GMT</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel that I must throw my computer out the window.  Should I read dozens of manuals and fix hundreds of bugs just to make my computer usable?  I don't think so.  Computers are not fun today.  Although this problem of mine is Linux/Unix specific, computing is full of this kind of problems.</p>
<p>I just wanted to disable this stupid visual bell under X which irritates the hell out of me so I googled for "disable visual bell" (not google-quoted) and other similar things and found the visible bell mini-howto.  It says that I need to do an "xset -b" to disable this thing so I did it.  The command had no output so I thought everything is okay.  Unfortunately it changed nothing.  Thinking that it's a GNOME specific problem I went to gconf-editor and searched for "bell" in keys and values.  I found some related Metacity keys and changed them.  Same shit.  X visual-bells whenever I try to search for an invalid string in Firefox or in Emacs.  In Emacs I could disable the bell unlike in Firefox.</p>
<p>So should I disable the visual bell in every single application I encounter?  Yeah?  It's really damn funny!</p>
<p>UPDATE: Later somehow I magically fixed this problem by messing around with gconf-editor.  Maybe I was just too frustrated earlier.</p>
