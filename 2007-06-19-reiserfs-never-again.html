<h1>ReiserFS: Never Again!</h1>
<p>2007-06-19 08:36:28 GMT</p>
<p>I've had such unpleasant experiences with ReiserFS in the past that I decided that I'll never use it again.  A couple of days ago, I had a nasty power failure and when I rebooted my box, the root fs (which was ReiserFS) had mount problems.  I had to fsck it with the rebuild tree option in order to be able to successfully mount it.  This happened twice in a row.  My friends and I also had the same experience several years back.</p>
<p>I'll stick with ext3 for most of the time, except for storing large files for which I use JFS.</p>
