<h1>UC: Site Improvements</h1>
<p>2007-02-06 01:06:46 GMT</p>
<p>I've made some improvements on the <a href="http://ultimatecommander.org" title="http://ultimatecommander.org">UC site</a> a few days ago and I think it's a lot easier to navigate it as a result of these improvements.  I've also put up some shameless advertising.  I don't like to disturb users with ads, but currently it's the only way to make some money from the project so hopefully I'll be able to spend more time on development.</p>
