<h1>Monda.hu is finished!</h1>
<p>2005-10-09 21:10:55 GMT</p>
<p>I started to agressively work on <a href="http://monda.hu" title="http://monda.hu">monda.hu</a> a month earlier or so.  That was because I finally got some free time and I've been making promises to my mother for a long time that I'll make her a <a href="http://mondakara.hu">home page</a>.  She's a furniture painter folk artist and a good site may greatly increase her income and business contacts.</p>
<p>In the beginning I was thinking in coding all the stuff alone from the scratch which was very frustrating.  After that, a light bulb appeared above my head and bang, the magical idea manifestated within me: <strong>reuse</strong>.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty obvious, doesn't it?  I'm just thinking about why reusing wasn't the first thing that popped into my mind.  After all when I start solving a problem, I generally immediately look for libraries that I can (re)use, so why the hell in this situation didn't I thought of reuse?</p>
<p>I think there are two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Web applications differ from libraries.  Libraries have a well defined interface, but application interfaces are generally loosely defined and arbitrary.  Every application is more-or-less a discrete universe.  I – in contrast to most Unix folks – even hate piping processes together because the stream flowing through them is an unstructured mess and I don't trust in that, unless it is something structured, like XML.</li>
<li>Bad experiences: I had some negative experiences installing various PHP applications in the past.  I consider PHP basically a hack.  The mere vision of variable names starting with the dollar ($) sign makes me feel bad.  PHP has only one very big advantage in my opinion and that is wide deployment.  You can really find it everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a good lesson for me to generalize the concept of reusable components in terms of web applications.  I'm very proud of this work because I think I wisely chosed, configured and interlinked the components, namely DokuWiki and WordPress in a usable and elegant way.  I've also took care of the details and hacked the source in many places to improve the look-and-feel and the general usability of the site.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress Autoparagraphing Madness</strong></p>
<p>My blog entries had an unnecessary newline in their ends which made the page layout a bit disturbing.  I dwelved into the WordPress code and found the problem.  WordPress autoparagraphs the blog entries which is a generally usable feature, but it conflicts with the DokuWiki plugin and this extra newline is its side effect.</p>
<p>In short one needs to comment out line #73 in <code>&lt;wordpress_root&gt;/wp-includes/functions-formatting.php</code>.</p>
