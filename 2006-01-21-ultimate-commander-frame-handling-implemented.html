<h1>Ultimate Commander: Frame Handling Implemented</h1>
<p>2006-01-21 13:19:46 GMT</p>
<p>I've just <a title="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=9526066&amp;forum_id=46939" href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=9526066&amp;forum_id=46939">committed</a> the basic frame handling functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/ultimate-commander">repo</a>.  Frame handling in UC is part of an advanced interaction design which eliminates the need of more windows.</p>
<p>The concept is that the applications is composed of one, and only one window.  Why?  Because fiddling with tons of windows is not much fun.  I heard many people talking about how much burden handling many windows is and I have the same opinion on the issue.</p>
<p>Here is a little demonstration to show you what I'm talking about.  Just to make it clear, the file operatons are not implemented yet.  Here's the initial state of UC:</p>

<p>Let's say the user wants to configure the listing of the right panel.  Then (s)he presses the "Set Listing" toggle button on the right panel.  Here's what happens:</p>
<p><img src="http://monda.hu/blog/wp-content/uploads/ultimate-commander-frames-2.png" alt="ultimate-commander-frames-2" width="640" height="497" /></p>
<p>As you can see a tabbar and the related tab appears on the left panel frame.  There is no overlapping like in the case of an additional window.  It's simple and beautiful.</p>
<p>I've made many changes to the codebase in the last few days and I didn't clean up the code so it's a bit messy now.  Apart from small refactorizations, I guess I overuse accessors a bit.  I need to educate myself more on the topic.</p>
<p>As a last note it's nice to see how friendly the Free Software Community really is.  When I requested a logo designer in the help wanted section of SourceForge, I got many help from more people and they were very kind and willing to cooperate.  I've experienced the same attitude on the GTK IRC channels and mailing lists also.</p>
