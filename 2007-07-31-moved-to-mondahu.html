<p>If you're reading this post then you've probably been redirected to monda.hu from laci.monda.hu.  I learn more and more on SEO and I also apply in practice what I learn.  This is one step of the many.  Being present on a higher level domain gives you better rankings.</p>
<p>monda.hu was mostly unused.  It only had the welcome screen of my family, some links and some scripts.</p>
