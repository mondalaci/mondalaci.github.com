<h1>Some skins and themes I created</h1>
<p>2004-10-29 00:28:04 GMT</p>
<p>Even though I'm not a graphics artist I created some skins and themes in the past that I'd like to share with you.  I've made these available both <a href="http://gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=mondalaci">on Gnome-Look.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/skins-and-themes">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Unix-clear?content=123618"><strong>Unix-clear XMMS skin</strong></a></p>
<p>This is my first skin and quite frankly, I'm not impressed but I share this with you anyways because it's part of the history of humanity.  :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/m7c?content=123619"><strong>m7c XMMS skin</strong></a></p>
<p>A lot better based on my opinion and others' comments. I personally like it.</p>

<p><a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Explicit+Flatness?content=123620"><strong>Explicit Flatness XMMS skin</strong></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty satisfied with this piece of skin and decided that I won't make any more.</p>

<p><a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Explicit+Flatness?content=123621"><strong>Explicit Flatness Metacity theme</strong></a></p>
<p>This theme is based on the XMMS skin of the related name.</p>
