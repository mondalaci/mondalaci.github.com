<h1>Noname Mini Mouse disassembly</h1>
<p>2010-12-04 19:45:45 GMT</p>
<p>A girlfriend of a friend of mine asked me to repair her mouse because the wire has been chewed by her rabbit.</p>
<p>Her rabbit...  Can you believe that?</p>
<p>Anyways, I was on a mission to fix this (rather unergonomic) mouse.  I cannot blame the designers because it's clearly a promotional product so it's main purpose is marketing, not a product for everyday use.  Despite of this, the girl in question is crazy enough to use it everyday.  (Which is not so much of a surprise given the computer savviness of girls, except the much respected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeri_Ellsworth">Jeri Ellsworth</a>).</p>
<p>The repair procedure was a no brainer, except looking up the pins of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=om21ps">OM21PS USB+PS/2 MCU+Sensor 2-in-1 optical mouse IC</a> to find out how the USB cable wire colors relate to their function.  The existence of such multi-function ASICs is one of the main reasons why electronics is so damn small nowadays.</p>
