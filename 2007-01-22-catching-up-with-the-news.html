<h1>Catching up with the News</h1>
<p>2007-01-22 02:31:52 GMT</p>
<p>I've successfully catched up with the news in the past couple days.  I was lagging behind by about two months, the longest lag I ever had regarding the news that interest me.  It was because I realized how inefficiently I was reading news.  As none of the existing PHP feed readers satisfied my tasty needs, I created my own reader which I now use and it perfectly fits my needs.</p>
<p>I was thinking of releasing it, but doing so properly would require much larger efforts than making a plain tarball from it and I don't want to invest that much time into it yet.  Maybe I'll do it in the future, because I think it's a really great piece of software even if it has some missing functionality and is a bit immature.</p>
<p>Some interesting news of the past couple of weeks:</p>
