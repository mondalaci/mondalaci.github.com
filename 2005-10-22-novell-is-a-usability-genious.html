<h1>Novell is a Usability Genious</h1>
<p>2005-10-22 17:14:58 GMT</p>
<p>Web developers at Novell have an icredible sense on usability.  They create exceptionally clear, simple, stylish and usable sites.  Some examples are <a href="http://beagle-project.org" title="http://beagle-project.org">http://beagle-project.org</a>, <a href="http://mono-project.com" title="http://mono-project.com">http://mono-project.com</a>, <a href="http://tango-project.org" title="http://tango-project.org">http://tango-project.org</a>, <a href="http://betterdesktop.org" title="http://betterdesktop.org">http://betterdesktop.org</a>, <a href="http://hula-project.org" title="http://hula-project.org">http://hula-project.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wikified Universe</strong></p>
<p>Wiki is a huge phenomenon.  It's not hard to see that Novell folks, like most people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> the most, while <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki" title="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a> and <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/" title="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a> also seems to be very popular.</p>
<p><strong>Smoking Bus Drivers</strong></p>
<p>I travel every week back and forth between my home and the university by bus.  Sometimes bus drivers begin to smoke while driving right in front of me.  As soon as I smell that disgusting smell I politely ask them "Excuse me, could you please turn off that cigarette?".  Although I always do this in a moderated tone, I could literally kill them.</p>
<p>Don't make me unleash my unstoppable fierce out to the world, because no one's gonna survive!</p>
<p><em>As a side note, it's funny that both the "bus" and "driver" words have computer related meanings as well as "smoking" is applied to hot girls.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miguel Rocks!</strong></p>
