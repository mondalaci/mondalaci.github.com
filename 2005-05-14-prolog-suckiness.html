<h1>Prolog Suckiness</h1>
<p>2005-05-14 10:35:50 GMT</p>
<p>I had to write a simple Pascal parser in Prolog for my programming course of this semester.  The rough specification: print the names and line numbers of the procedures and functions found in the Pascal code to be parsed.</p>
<p>Prolog is a nightmare if you wanna write imperative code.  I've came up with the following mess (also <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/misc/blob/master/prolog-parser.pl">available on GitHub</a>):</p>

<p>You shouldn't see anything like this in your future life.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Research Demo</strong></p>
<p>I've written another application.  Unlike the previous one, it's a GUI application which i've made for the operational research course of the university.  It features an incremental UI.  I mean on this a kind of UI which the user can incrementally fill out as he/she gives more and more information during the input rather than having to handle tons of pop-ups throughout the process.  I think it's a much more usable interaction model.</p>
<p>See it for yourself:</p>

<p>Operational Research Demo is written in Python using PyGTK and you're free to <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/operational-research-demo">download it</a>.</p>

<p>I've been dreaming for a long time about a well designed, parallelized init system and finally it seems my dream has come true.  I hadn't have the time to check it out, but the boot charts seem very promising.</p>
<p><strong>Comments Disabled</strong></p>
<p>I've just disabled the comments and pings in every of my posts because I got massively spammed by various WordPress worms.  On the other hand it's not a real pain for me, because my blog is not really popular.  Honestly I don't mind it all, since I write mainly to summarize my thoughts and make a diary of my journeys.</p>
