<p>Many times I found South Park's kind of humor overly primitive and far fetched.  Not this time!  I've just found a real gem, episode titled "<a href="http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/southpark/season5/southpark-507.htm" title="http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/southpark/season5/southpark-507.htm">Proper Condom Use</a>".  It's full of grotesque humor of a special kind.  A must see.</p>
