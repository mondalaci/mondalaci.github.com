<h1>Learning Gtk#</h1>
<p>2005-10-28 17:47:00 GMT</p>
<p>I'm learning <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/" title="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">Gtk#</a> these days.  Well, I don't need to learn so much Gtk anymore, but rather C# which is very well-suited for creating GUIs.  That's mainly because of several special language constructs like accessors and delegates.  On the other hand it's a strict, strongly-typed language that is a little bit unusual for me after so much Python.  This kind of strict nature of C# makes it able to run suprisingly fast.  I cannot tell you some exact statistics on it, but some say in several cases C++ is only 2x faster than C#.  I think the situation is not so ideal.  I guess it's 5x or so.</p>
<p>I'm learning C# because I wanna rewrite <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/ultimate-commander" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ulc">Ultimate Commander</a> in it.  This has proven to be a hard task, especially because I want to make it very usable in terms of user interaction by specializing widgets to fine-tune some of their details which I think are important.</p>
<p>Gtk# has several nontrivial issues, so <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/gtk-sharp-list/2005-October/thread.html#6517" title="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/gtk-sharp-list/2005-October/thread.html#6517">I hang out on the mailing lists</a> regularly these times.  I also began to help others as I have some experiences in Gtk.  It feels good helping people.</p>
