<p>I'm getting worried.  What do you think it is?</p>

<p>No, this isn't a huge ice berg from the Antarctica mirrored vertically.  I can help you a bit by showing you a farther shot.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's our fridge in the subtlet.  I should seriously consider thawing this weird formation.  The only problem is that there's too much food in the fridge and everyone of us would need to remove his food for a while, so I have to wait for this to happen.  In the meantime it could be useful for reducing the global warming.  At least I hope so.</p>
