<p>You shouldn't buy Princo DVDs.  They are a piece of shit.  Really.  This is not "Write once", but "Write once and pray" kind of category.</p>

<p><strong>Miguel in Antitrust</strong></p>
<p>One of my very favourite movies, <a title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218817/" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218817/">Antitrust</a> <a title="http://www.linuxworld.com/read/32956.htm" href="http://www.linuxworld.com/read/32956.htm">features</a> <a title="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/" href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/">Miguel De Icaza</a>.  I've just wathced the related scene.  Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Zope versus PHP</strong></p>
<p><a title="http://www.zope.org/" href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> has a really unique architecture.  I'm not an expert, but I know some things about it and wanna learn more in the future.  I thought it's a very powerful platform to build on.  I was interested why it is that PHP is used everywhere and Zope is not (well) known to the average web developer so I went after the topic and have found a <a title="http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2004-December/thread.html" href="http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2004-December/thread.html">thread</a> called "PHP vs. Zope/Plone? Which better overall and for what?" on the topic.  In short, Zope's nature as an application server, as a framework, and as a paradigm makes it alien and hard to grasp to the masses despite its power.  It's also possible that Zope runs slower than PHP, althought I guess the difference is probably not that significant.  PHP may also rule in cases where the given task is very special in nature.</p>
