<p>Ever wanted to remember the namedays of your relatives, friends?  It has frustrated me to the point where I wanted to write a dedicated application that does the thing, but it seems there's a fairly good solution using RSS which I haven't thought of.  <a href="http://rss.messze.net/" title="http://rss.messze.net/">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>This idea could be further extended by providing separate user accounts and allowing the users to define specific birthdays.  Very elegant, very smooth.</p>
