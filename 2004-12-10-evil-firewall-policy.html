<h1>Evil Firewall Policy</h1>
<p>2004-12-10 11:49:15 GMT</p>
<p>I couldn't blog this week.  This was because one of the sysadmins at the university computer science department blocked the server which hosts my home page.  This server hosts thousands of other sites too which are full of warez and some students here regulary download all those shit which causes massive bandwidth consumption which costs a lot of money to the university.  I came up with various alternative solutions:</p>
<p>1) Monitor user traffic.  If the traffic exceeds a well-chosen limit per user, fall back to a lower bandwidth.  The problem is that there are huge pages on the web with full of fancy shit.  If someone surfs the web for some hours on these sites, (s)he can easily generate hundreds of megabytes of traffic.  There are other downloading activities also which don't incorporate any warez.  Moreover there are a bunch of technical difficulties implementing this idea. For example the LDAP server and the firewall don't communicate well with each other.</p>
<p>2) Scan FTP and HTTP URIs for multimedia file suffixes and track them per user.  This would require a few dedicated hosts because of the 1 gigabit bandwidth. It's a pretty computationally and I/O intensive task.  The other problem is that most warez is compressed in various different formats so the file suffix tells nothing about the content this way.</p>
<p>3) Kick the asses of all the warez folks.  This would be the most easier and gratifying job to do.  Unfortunately this option depends either on 2) or 3).</p>
<p>I don't know what to do in a situation like this, but this evil policy makes me mad.  If nothing's gonna change I'll probably only blog on the weekends which is not that huge tragedy after all.</p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong></p>
<p>I've made a <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/misc/blob/master/mono.ps">Mono advertisement postscript graphics</a> for my computer graphics course of this semester.  Here is how it looks like:</p>

<p><strong>News</strong></p>
<p>A few developers were talking in the past about <a href="http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8888">reducing the boot time</a> by using parallelized process execution.  This is on my current wishlist so it sounds like a beautiful project.</p>
