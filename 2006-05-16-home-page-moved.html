<h1>Home Page Moved</h1>
<p>2006-05-16 17:52:49 GMT</p>
<p>I've successfully moved my home page from <a href="http://objectis.org">Objectis</a> to <a href="http://monda.hu">monda.hu</a>, powered by MediaWiki.  I loved Plone, but Objectis was slow and I didn't like Plone's markup language very much.  I've also customized the default CSS in a way that the header mimics my blog header and shared a navigation bar between my blog and my home page, so they are nicely integrated now.  An average Joe couldn't tell that I'm using different CMSes.  I'm pretty satisfied with my work, though the CSS still needs some love.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Objectis for hosting my home page so far.  They provided a reliable service and I had much fun working with Plone.</p>
