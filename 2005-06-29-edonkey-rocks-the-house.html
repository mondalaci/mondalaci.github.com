<h1>eDonkey Rocks the House</h1>

<p>I was making a journey in the peer to peer file sharing world.  I wanted to know which network is worth using.  Until this time I believed that Direct Connect is the most superior network, but I'm compeletly reframed after I expanded my horizont.</p>
<p>It seems that the best network is eDonkey 2000.  There are some reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>no stupid hub rules</li>
<li>rare files are more accessible because of the balancing algorithm</li>
<li>much more users (5 million) accessible simultaneously than on all the DC hubs together</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just scratching the surface here.  As far as I know, the protocol is also better in more aspects, primarily regarding error handling.  For me, DC is dead.  There is one disadvantage however.  If you download much faster than you upload (typical DSL situation), then the overall download speed on eDonkey will be less than on DC because the upload/download ratio should be around 1 by protocol specification.  Fortunately it's only bad for leeches and I'm not one of them.</p>
<p>You can get some awesome <a href="http://www.slyck.com/stats.php">statistics</a> on the networks, as well as documentation on the available clients at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/">zeropaid</a>.</p>
