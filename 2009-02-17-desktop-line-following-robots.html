<p>My mind is absolutely blown away by the creative uses of microcontrollers and various peripherals.  The <a href="http://elm-chan.org/works/ltc/report.html" title="http://elm-chan.org/works/ltc/report.html">ELM desktop line following robot</a> is one of the coolest projects I've ever seen in my entire life.  It turns out that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=line%20following%20robot&amp;search=Search" title="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=line%20following%20robot&amp;search=Search">line following robots</a> are pretty common in robotics and there are various contests in which robots can compete with each other.</p>
<p>Thanks Technik for showing me this gem!</p>
