<p>This device is driven by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=CM108+High+Integrated+USB+Audio+I/O+Controller+datasheet">CM108 High Integrated USB Audio I/O Controller</a>.  Apart from that IC it has only a handful of components like the two audio jacks, the USB plug, the crystal, a couple of capacitors and some resistors.  The device shows up as "C-Media USB Headphone Set" because no external EEPROM is used for custom configuration.</p>
