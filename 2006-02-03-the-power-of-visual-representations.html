<h1>The Power of Visual Representations</h1>

<p>I'm always impressed by the power of visual representations.  They seem to be much more natural and intuitive than formal representations.  The <a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 license</a> is probably one of the best examples out there how one can harness this kind of power the most efficiently:</p>

<p>Of couse everything that is powerful in our universe can be well-used and abused also.  Marketing exemplifies the best how one can selfishly abuse visual power by notoriously emphasizing the benefits of his/her products or services while neglecting their disadvantages or putting them in the footnote written with the smallest font size that nobody can really read without a microscope.</p>
<p>From now on I will consciously strive to make my blog more visual by including related images in my posts.</p>
