<h1>Standing Out</h1>
<p>2005-11-25 14:05:02 GMT</p>
<p>In one of the earlier articles of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/" title="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/">Seth Nickell</a>, titled "<a href="http://www.gnomejournal.org/article/5/experimental-culture" title="http://www.gnomejournal.org/article/5/experimental-culture">Experimental Culture</a>", he writes about how GNOME became more traditional while KDE became more innovative.  It seems to me that a new generation of Gtk# applications may turn this situation upside down.</p>
<p>There are several apps that really stand out.  Most notably they are <a href="http://beaglewiki.org/Main_Page" title="http://beaglewiki.org/Main_Page">Beagle</a> and <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/" title="http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/">F-Spot</a>.  F-Spot has a new tag management interface which is very revolutionary in terms of user interaction.  It's a really original idea recently implemented by <a href="http://www.nat.org/" title="http://www.nat.org/">Nat Friedman</a> which makes one's productivity fly.  You gotta watch the <a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/weblog.php/2005/Nov/11#Tags?flav=php" title="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/weblog.php/2005/Nov/11#Tags?flav=php">screen capture</a>.</p>
<p>Another useful application – although not so innovative – is <a href="http://pwp.netcabo.pt/paol/tagtool/" title="http://pwp.netcabo.pt/paol/tagtool/">Audio Tag Tool</a>.  I haven't tried it yet, but I will.</p>
