<p>I have this board for a while so it was time to shoot some images to show its guts.  It is currently the best keyboard on the market in my opinion, except that I prefer blue switches.  I ordered browns this time because I wanted to try them out.</p>
<p>This board is constructed in a much sturdier way than the Das.  You won't break anything when disassembling it because Diatec used thick plastic everywhere without any overhangs.</p>
<p>The brain is the <a href="http://www.holtek.com.tw/english/docum/computer/82k94x.htm">HT82K94E USB Multimedia Keyboard Encoder 8-Bit MCU</a> which is the big brother or <a href="http://www.holtek.com/chinese/docum/computer/82k95x.htm">HT82K95E</a> which <a href="http://monda.hu/blog/2009/05/11/das-keyboard-disassembly-and-analysis/">was used in the Das</a>.  I'm not sure whether breaking out the MCU was a practical move or a smart sales tactic (to differentiate between the price of the NKRO and non-NKRO version) but it's an interesting solution.</p>
