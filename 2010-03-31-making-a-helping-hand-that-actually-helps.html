<h1>Making a helping hand that actually helps</h1>

<p>I've seen some helping hands offered by various shops and I'm not impressed at all.  Their price is usually dirt cheap and I can say from experience that you get what you pay for.  The only viable solution is to build a kickass helping hand for yourself.  Fortunately, Instructables has some really great tutorials:</p>

</ul>
<p>I've been trying to get the parts for a while but it's very challenging to source the hoses.  If I won't be able to get them from Hungary then I'll order them from a foreign country.</p>
