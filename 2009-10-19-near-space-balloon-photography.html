<p>I'm absolutely blown away by <a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/09/19/high-altitude-balloons/">near-space balloon photography</a>!</p>
<p>On a related note, it's also good to know about the <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK firmware</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR imaging</a>.Â  I won't think much about the brand of my future digicam.</p>
