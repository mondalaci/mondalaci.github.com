<h1>Geolocating IP Addresses</h1>
<p>2005-12-07 12:31:54 GMT</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hostip.info" title="http://www.hostip.info">hostip.info</a> provides a way to geolocate any IP addresses.  So given an IP address you can query the city, latitude and longitude of the originating location.  The database can be improved throught the web interface which you should do like I did.</p>
<p>Maybe some days later I'll found a database which I can query my visitors' foot size with.  That'd be cool, although I don't really know what I'd do with those infos.  Maybe I'd open a new shoe store on the next corner.</p>
