<h1>About me</h1>
<link href="/blog/wp-content/soundmanager/mp3-player-button.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
<p>My name is <span class="text-to-be-played"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/laszlo-monda.mp3" title="Play &quot;László Monda&quot;" class="sm2_button">László Monda</a> László Monda</span> and my nickname is <span class="text-to-be-played"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/laci.mp3" title="Play &quot;Laci&quot;" class="sm2_button">Laci</a> Laci</span> which is the Hungarian nickname of László.  I'm a <a href="http://www.typelogic.com/intj.html">not-so-average</a> guy interested in a wide array of technologies.  I'm also interested in various topics such as human behaviour, sustainability and leading a healthy lifestyle.  Not many people know but I'm even interested in the mating habits of bumblebees.  Just kidding.  :)</p>
<p>As for my life philosophy, I deeply value freedom, transparency, creativity and like to be surrounded by giving, knowledgable and positive-minded people.  I want to be more and better day by day at every area that is important to me.  I try to live a happy life in a way of not hurting anybody, but growing, sharing and making the world a better place for everyone.  </p>
<p>I lead a life that is both healtly and minimizes my ecological footprint by walking and biking over short distances, doing sports regularly, eating mostly vegetarian food, drinking filtered tap water instead of buying bottled water, using a fair amount of bioproducts, selectively collecting waste and using long-lasting cloth bags instead of disposable plastic bags.  I never smoked a cigarette in my life.</p>
<p>I use Free and Open Source Software, buy Open Hardware whenever possible and use Linux for pretty much everything.  I consider FOSS a practical ideology.  Even though I'm aware that most users simply want to use their devices out of the box I think that it's incredibly practical and empowering to be able to infinitely customize our devices to suit our specific needs.  Having faced with DVD players that featured miniature subtitle fonts that couldn't be enlarged or with routers that only supported a single dynamic DNS provider I concluded that closed source potentially seriously limits usability.  Such devices are black boxes driven by software that don't exploit their full potential.</p>
<p>In the same vein, I much prefer companies who operate based on Free and Open Source principles, be it a hardware or software company.  I understand the need of companies to keep some of their intellectual property closed to provide value-added services and stay competitive, but I think there's a healthy balance and most companies are way more closed than they should ideally be.  Regardless of openness what I really cannot stand is companies who abuse their power by locking-in customers, suing the hell out of others based on obvious patents or designing for obsolescence.  These companies won't get a damn cent from me.</p>
<p>I consider myself fairly stubborn.  If a project truly captures my interest then I do everything within my power to make it a reality.  I'm also very concerned about the quality of everything I do that is important to me.</p>
<p>As a last word, here's a beautiful quote that I feel very close to:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.</p>
<p>- Theodore Roosevelt
