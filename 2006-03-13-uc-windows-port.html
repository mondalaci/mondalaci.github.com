<h1>UC Windows Port</h1>
<p>2006-03-13 22:30:22 GMT</p>
<p>I've demoed UC to <a title="http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~bilickiv/index_eng.html" href="http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~bilickiv/index_eng.html">Vilmos Bilicki</a>, who is my mentor in relation with my master thesis project (which is UC).  He was very enthusiastic and told me that he'd use UC if it ran on Windows.  I was thinking about porting UC to Windows even before, but he was giving me a further push, so I did a try this time.</p>
<p>I had a talk with Francisco T. Martinez a la <a title="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/" href="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/">Paco</a> on #Mono.  He directed me to his <a title="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfcontent/downloads.php/monowin32/Mono%20Win32%20Combined%20Installer/" href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfcontent/downloads.php/monowin32/Mono%20Win32%20Combined%20Installer/">expermiental Windows Mono Installer</a> which incorporates the Gnome bindings, not just Gtk# as the official installer.  Using his stuff it was easy to port UC to Windows.  Well I've not entirely ported it, just to make the GUI work, but it's nice to see how fine it looks on Windows:</p>

<p>He told me that the extra bindings of his expermental installer will be a part of the official installer soon.  Very nice!</p>
<p>I'll try to maintain UC in the future respecting the Windows port.  I think it worths the additional maintenance burden which is not too heavy with Mono.</p>
