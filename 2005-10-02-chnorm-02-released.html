<h1>Chnorm 0.2 Released</h1>
<p>2005-10-02 12:03:50 GMT</p>
<p>As the title says.  <a href="https://github.com/mondalaci/chnorm">Chnorm</a> became more usable and totally pythonificated.  Grab it and have a lot a fun with it!</p>
<p>I've used the Python optparse module for parsing the options.  In its documentation there is a very good section about <a title="http://docs.python.org/lib/optparse-background.html" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/optparse-background.html">the concepts around the command line interface</a> and its design as well as a criticism of some popular application that have a braindead CLI.</p>
